It was last visible in the night sky during the Stone Age.\r\n\r\nDiscovered on March 2, 2022, by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility’s wide-field survey camera at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, the comet made its closest approach to the sun on January 12, according to NASA.\r\n\r\nNamed C/2022 E3 (ZTF), the comet has an orbit around the sun that passes through the outer reaches of the solar system, which is why it’s taken such a long route — and long time — to swing by Earth again, according to The Planetary Society.\r\n\r\nThe icy celestial object will make its closest pass by Earth between February 1 and February 2, around 26 million miles to 27 million miles (42 million kilometers to 44 million kilometers) away, according to EarthSky.\r\n\r\nEven during its closest approach, the comet will still be more than 100 times the moon’s distance away from Earth, according to EarthSky.\r\n\r\nAs the comet nears Earth, observers will be able to spot it as a faint green smudge near the bright star Polaris, also called the North Star. Comets reflect different colors of light due to their current positions in orbit and chemical compositions.\r\n\r\nEarly morning skies, once the moon has set after midnight for those in the Northern Hemisphere, are optimal for viewing the comet. The space object will be more difficult to see for those in the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe comet can be distinguished from stars by its streaking tails of dust and energized particles, as well as the glowing green coma surrounding it.\r\n\r\nThe coma is an envelope that forms around a comet as it passes close to the sun, causing its ice to sublimate, or turn directly to gas. This causes the comet to look fuzzy when observed through telescopes.\r\n\r\nAfter passing by Earth, the comet will make its closest approach of Mars on February 10, according to EarthSky.\r\n\r\nIf clouds or inclement weather get in the way of skywatching, The Virtual Telescope Project will share a livestream of the comet in the skies above Rome.

The attack left 217 injured, Ansari added.\r\n\r\nA police official who survived the explosion, Nasarullah Khan, said he remembered seeing “a huge burst of flames” before becoming surrounded by a plume of black dust.\r\n\r\nKhan said his foot broke in the blast and he was stuck in the rubble for three hours.\r\n\r\n“The ceiling fell in … the space in between the ceiling and wall is where I managed to survive,” he said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, hope was fading in the search for survivors as rescue workers sifted through the rubble of the mosque that was all but destroyed Monday, when worshipers – mainly law enforcement officials – had gathered for evening prayers.\r\n\r\nPhotos and video show walls of the mosque reduced to fragments, with glass windows and paneling destroyed in the powerful blast.\r\n\r\n“We are not expecting anyone alive to be found. Mostly dead bodies are being recovered,” Bilal Faizi, a rescue spokesperson, said Tuesday.\r\n\r\nConflicting claims\r\nThe blast Monday is the latest sign of the deteriorating security situation in Peshawar, capital of the restive Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan and the site of frequent attacks by the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP).\r\n\r\nThe TTP is a US-designated foreign terrorist organization operating in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.\r\n\r\nLast year, the breakdown of an already shaky year-long ceasefire between the TTP and Pakistan’s government threatened not only escalating violence in that country but potentially an increase in cross-border tensions between the Afghan and Pakistani governments.\r\n\r\nInitially on Monday, TTP officials Sarbakaf Mohmand and Omar Mukaram Khurasani had claimed the blast was “revenge” for the death of TTP militant Khalid Khorasani last year.\r\n\r\nBut the TTP’s main spokesperson later denied the group was involved in the attack.\r\n\r\n“Regarding the Peshawar incident, we consider it necessary to clarify that Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan has nothing to do with this incident,” TTP spokesperson Muhammad Khorasani said in a statement late Monday. “According to our laws and general constitution, any action in mosques, madrasas, funerals grounds and other sacred places is an offense.”\r\n\r\nPakistan authorities say an investigation is underway and have not confirmed either claim.\r\n\r\nGen. Asim Munir, chief of army staff of Pakistan, condemned the attack and said the perpetrators would be brought to justice.\r\n\r\nMunir urged commanders to focus on anti-terrorism operations and work with intelligence and law enforcement agencies across the country with “renewed resolve,” according to a statement released by the Pakistani military. He said this coordination would continue until “sustainable peace” is achieved.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Peshawar Police Chief Mohammad Aijaz Khan said the blast inside the Police Lines Mosque was “probably a suicide attack,” echoing a statement from Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\r\n\r\n“The brutal killing of Muslims prostrating before Allah is against the teachings of the Quran,” Sharif said, adding that “targeting the House of Allah is proof that the attackers have nothing to do with Islam.”\r\n\r\n‘A national security crisis’\r\nRights groups have condemned the deadly attack, which has raised fears of fresh violence amid a deteriorating security situation in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in a statement Monday said the attack could have been avoided if the “state heeded earlier warnings from civil society about extremist outfits in the province.”\r\n\r\n“Ill-equipped law enforcement personnel continue to be targeted in incidents that dearly cost civilian and police lives. We demand the state take action now,” the statement said.\r\n\r\nMadiha Afzal, a fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the 2021 Taliban takeover in Afghanistan has “emboldened” the TTP and other terror groups.\r\n\r\n“The TTP has also been emboldened by a Pakistani state that has had a shaky, uncertain response to the group in the last couple of years,” she said, adding a “sloppy policy toward terrorist groups has been more or less consistent across governments in Pakistan since the mid-2000s.”\r\n\r\nNegotiations with the militants have “failed repeatedly because these groups are existentially opposed to the Pakistani state and constitution,” she added.\r\n\r\n“This is now a national security crisis for Pakistan once again. The solution has to be a concerted military operation (against the TTP),” she said. “But that is now complicated by the fact that the TTP can go across the border into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.”\r\n\r\nThe attack also comes at a fragile time for Pakistan, which has been grappling with a cost of living crisis as food and fuel shortages wreak havoc in the country of 220 million.\r\n\r\nSharif’s government has struggled to revive the country’s economy, further devastated by deadly floods last year that killed more than 1,500 people and submerged entire villages.', '230130094830-01-peshawar-mosque-013023.jpg', 'Police officers clear the way for ambulances following the blast in Peshawar, Pakistan, on January 30, 2023.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:02:22', '2023-02-01 01:02:22'),
(3, 'Former Wagner commander describes brutality and incompetence on the frontline', 1, ' \r\nA former Wagner mercenary says the brutality he witnessed in Ukraine ultimately pushed him to defect, in an exclusive CNN interview on Monday.\r\n\r\nWagner fighters were often sent into battle with little direction, and the company’s treatment of reluctant recruits was ruthless, Andrei Medvedev told CNN’s Anderson Cooper from Norway’s capital Oslo, where he is seeking asylum after crossing that country’s arctic border from Russia.\r\n\r\n“They would round up those who did not want to fight and shoot them in front of newcomers,” he alleges. “They brought two prisoners who refused to go fight and they shot them in front of everyone and buried them right in the trenches that were dug by the trainees.”\r\n\r\nThe 26-year-old, who says he previously served in the Russian military, joined Wagner as a volunteer. He crossed into Ukraine less than 10 days after signing his contract in July 2022, serving near Bakhmut, the frontline city in the Donetsk region. The mercenary group has emerged as a key player in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nMedvedev said he reported directly to the group’s founders, Dmitry Utkin and Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, whom he describes as “the devil.”\r\n\r\n“If (Prigozhin) was a Russian hero, he would have taken a gun and run with the soldiers,” Medvedev said.\r\n\r\nIn a statement emailed to CNN on Tuesday, Prigozhin declined to comment on “military issues” and described Wagner as an “exemplary military organization that complies with all the necessary laws and rules of modern wars.” The Wagner boss has previously confirmed that Medvedev had served in his company, and said that he “should have been prosecuted for attempting to mistreat prisoners.”\r\n\r\nMedvedev told CNN that he did not want to comment on what he’d done himself while fighting in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n‘No real tactics’\r\nMedvedev spoke to CNN from Oslo after crossing its border in a daring defection that, he says saw him evade arrest “at least ten times” and dodge bullets from Russian forces. He crossed into Norway over an icy lake using white camouflage to blend in, he said.\r\n\r\nHe told CNN that he knew by the sixth day of his deployment in Ukraine that he did not want to return for another tour after witnessing troops being turned into cannon fodder.\r\n\r\nHe started off with 10 men under his command, a number that grew once prisoners were allowed to join, he said. “There were more dead bodies, and more, and more, people coming in. In the end I had a lot of people under my command,” he said. “I couldn’t count how many. They were in constant circulation. Dead bodies, more prisoners, more dead bodies, more prisoners.”\r\n\r\nWagner lacked a tactical strategy, with troops coming up with plans on the fly, Medvedev said.\r\n\r\n“There were no real tactics at all. We just got orders about the position of the adversary…There were no definite orders about how we should behave. We just planned how we would go about it, step by step. Who would open fire, what kind of shifts we would have…How it how it how it would turn out that was our problem,” he said.\r\n\r\nAdvocacy groups say prisoners who enlisted were told their families would receive a pay-out of five million rubles ($71,000) if they died in the war.\r\n\r\nBut in reality “nobody wanted to pay that kind of money,” Medvedev said. He alleged that many Russians who died fighting in Ukraine were “just declared missing.”\r\n\r\nPrigozhin dismissed the accusation in his response to CNN, saying “to date, not a single case of non-payment of insurance pay-outs has been recorded in the Wagner Group.”\r\n\r\n‘I saw courage on both sides’\r\nMedvedev was emotional at times in the interview, telling CNN that he saw courage on both sides of the war.\r\n\r\n“You know, I saw courage on both sides, on the Ukrainian side as well, and our boys too… I just want them to know that,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe added that he wants to now share his story in order to help bring Prigozhin and Russian President Vladimir Putin to justice.\r\n\r\n“Sooner or later the propaganda in Russia will stop working, the people will rise up and all our leaders …will be up for grabs and a new leader will emerge.”\r\n\r\nWagner is often described as Putin’s off-the-books troops. It has expanded its footprint globally since its creation in 2014, and has been accused of war crimes in Africa, Syria and Ukraine.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he fears the fate meted on another Wagner defector, Yevgeny Nuzhin, who was murdered on camera with a sledgehammer, Medvedev said Nuzhin’s death emboldened him to leave.\r\n\r\n“I would just say that it made me bolder, more determined to leave,” he said.', '230130140914-02-andrei-medvedev.jpg', 'Andrei Medvedev, a former Wagner commander, is photographed in Norway.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:06:27', '2023-02-01 01:06:27'),
(5, 'Scientists plot the resurrection of a bird that’s been extinct since the 17th century', 6, '\r\nNo other animal is as inexorably linked with extinction as the dodo, an odd-looking flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean until the late 17th century.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of sailors brought with them invasive species like rats and practices like hunting. They doomed the dodo, which showed no fear of humans, to extinction in the space of just a few decades.\r\n\r\nNow, a team of scientists wants to bring back the dodo in a bold initiative that will incorporate advances in ancient DNA sequencing, gene editing technology and synthetic biology. They hope the project will open up new techniques for bird conservation.\r\n\r\n“We’re clearly in the middle of an extinction crisis. And it’s our responsibility to bring stories and to bring excitement to people in way that motivates them to think about the extinction crisis that’s going on right now,” said Beth Shapiro, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nShapiro is the lead paleogeneticist at Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology and genetic engineering start-up founded by tech entrepreneur Ben Lamm and Harvard Medical School geneticist George Church, which is working on an equally ambitious projects to bring back the woolly mammoth and the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger.\r\n\r\nShapiro said that she had already completed a key first step in the project — fully sequencing the dodo’s genome from ancient DNA — based on genetic material extracted from dodo remains in Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to compare the genetic information with the dodo’s closest bird relatives in the pigeon family — the living Nicobar pigeon, and the extinct Rodrigues solitaire, a giant flightless pigeon that once lived on an island close to Mauritius. It’s a process which would allow them to narrow down which mutations in the genome “make a dodo a dodo,” Shapiro said.\r\n\r\nChallenges to resurrecting the dodo\r\nHowever, the subsequent work that’s needed to resurrect the animal — programming cells from a living relative of the dodo with the lost bird’s DNA — will be significantly more challenging. Shapiro said she hopes to adapt an existing technique used involving primordial germ cells, the embryonic precursors of sperm and eggs, that has already been used to create a chicken fathered by a duck.\r\n\r\nThe approach involves removing primordial gems cells from an egg, cultivating them in the lab and editing the cells with the desired genetic traits before injecting them back to an egg at the same developmental stage, she explained.\r\n\r\nEven if the team is successful in this high-stakes endeavor, they won’t be making a carbon copy of the dodo that lived four centuries ago, but an altered, hybrid form.\r\n\r\nHowever, Shapiro said that perfecting these synthetic biology tools will have wider implications for bird conservation. The techniques could allow scientists to move specific genetic traits between bird species to help protect them as habitats shrink and the climate warms.\r\n\r\n“This technology, which works in chickens…. it would be amazing to get this to work in lots of different birds across the bird tree of life because that will be hugely impactful for avian conservation,” Shapiro said.\r\n\r\n“If we find that there’s something that provides immunity against a disease that’s hurting a population, and you know what the genetic changes underlying that immunity or that ability to fight off that disease is — maybe we can use these tools to transfer that even between closely related species,” she added.\r\n\r\nMike McGrew, a senior lecturer and personal chair in avian reproductive technologies at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, described the project as a “moon launch for synthetic biology.” His work involves turning commercial egg-laying hens into surrogates for rare chicken breeds revived from frozen primordial germ cells.\r\n\r\n“The idea is you have to now be able to do this with pigeon species. And that’s the big, hard part jumping from chicken species, which many labs in the world do, to other bird species,” said McGrew, who is not directly involved in the dodo project but is part of Colossal’s scientific advisory board.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been trying for about 10 years to culture germ cells from other bird species. It’s hard,” he said.\r\n\r\nInvestment in de-extinction\r\nWhether or not Colossal and its team of scientists are ultimately successful in their quest to bring back the dodo and other extinct creatures, de-extinction projects, and the technological breakthroughs they may generate, have investors excited. Colossal also announced Tuesday that it has raised an additional $150 million, bringing the total amount of funding raised since the company launched in 2021 to $225 million.\r\n\r\nCritics, however, say the vast sums involved could be better put to use protecting the 400 or so bird species, and many other animals and plants, that are listed as endangered.\r\n\r\n“There’s so many things that desperately need our help. And money. Why would you even bother trying to save something long gone, when there’s so many things that are desperate right now?” said Julian Hume, an avian paleontologist at London’s Natural History Museum, who studies the dodo.\r\n\r\nDodo myths\r\nHume said there’s very little known about the dodo and lots of myths surround the creature. Even the origin of its name is a mystery, though he thinks it stems from the sound of the call the bird was said to have made — a low-pitched pigeon-like coo.\r\n\r\nMillions of years ago, the dodo’s ancestors lived in Southeast Asia, and when sea levels were low, it island-hopped its way to Mauritius, where it became isolated without predators once sea levels rose.\r\n\r\n“Flight is very (energetically) expensive. Why bother maintaining it if you don’t need it? All the fruit and food is on the ground, and when you’ve become flightless, you can become big. That’s what the dodo did, it just got bigger and bigger and bigger,” Hume said.\r\n\r\nAccording to a digital 3D model of the bird Hume developed based on a skeleton from the Durban Natural Science Museum in South Africa, the dodo once stood around 70 centimeters (2.3 feet) tall and weighed about 15 to 18 kilograms (33 to 39 pounds).\r\n\r\nThe model revealed the dodo was also likely more agile than the illustrations that depict it as a fat, ungainly bird might suggest.\r\n\r\nWe have the dodo to thank for introducing the idea of extinction to the world — a sad achievement still felt in the phrase as “dead as a dodo.”\r\n\r\nBack in the 1600s, before the first dinosaur fossils were widely known, “the concept of extinction didn’t exist. Everything was God’s creation and they were here forever. The idea that something can be wiped out was just not in anybody’s vocabulary,” Hume said.\r\n\r\n“It was such an extraordinary bird, even at the time of discovery,” he added. “They disappeared rapidly. So when people wanted to know more about them, there was none left.”', '230130114047-03-dodo-bring-back-from-extinction.jpg', 'The dodo, a flightless bird, was first spotted in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors and had disappeared by 1681.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:09:04', '2023-02-01 01:09:04'),
(6, 'Dead chickens and decomposing bodies: Inside South Africa’s power blackout ‘pandemic’', 7, 'Car crashes, opportunistic criminals, rotting food, decomposing bodies, bankrupt businesses, and water shortages. Welcome to life under South Africa’s power blackouts.\r\n\r\nLast week the grim extent of the outages was laid bare when South Africans were advised to bury dead loved ones within four days.\r\n\r\nIn a public statement, the South African Funeral Practitioners Association warned that bodies in mortuaries were rapidly decomposing because of the unrelenting electricity outages, putting huge pressure on funeral parlors struggling to process corpses.\r\n\r\nThe situation is so bad that the country’s President Cyril Ramaphosa is considering declaring a national disaster, similar to one in 2020 at the height of the Covid pandemic, which had a devastating effect on the country’s economy.\r\n\r\nLast week scores of supporters from the Democratic Alliance opposition party marched under heavy security through the streets of Johannesburg and Cape Town to voice their frustrations over the persistent blackouts.\r\n\r\nA difference between life and death\r\nKnown locally as loadshedding, widespread electricity blackouts are carried out multiple times a day by state-owned energy utility Eskom to avoid the total collapse of the grid.\r\n\r\nWhile the country has been experiencing on-off power outages for years, since September 2022 scheduled blackouts have become routine, affecting every part of South African society.\r\n\r\nFor some people, not having access to reliable power can be the difference between life and death.\r\n\r\nBefore she died in October 2022, Lis Van Os needed oxygen for 17 hours a day. Her stationary oxygen machine required mains power, making periods of loadshedding extremely stressful, particularly when power did not return as scheduled, her family said.\r\n\r\nHer daughter Karin McDonald was forced to explore backup options such as inverters and a back up oxygen mobile tank, which only lasted short periods.\r\n\r\n“Towards the end (of her life) power outages created a lot of anxiety for everyone,” she said.\r\n\r\n‘A pool of misery’\r\nSouth Africans experienced more than twice as many power cuts in 2022 than in any other year. And things are set to get worse in 2023.\r\n\r\nEven simple daily tasks need to be arranged around loadshedding schedules, including meal planning, travel times, work that requires internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nFrom preparing baby formula to keeping fans running during the summer heat, not having access to mains power is makes daily life challenging for South Africans.\r\n\r\nManeo Motsamai, a domestic worker in Johannesburg, says the outages prevents her from simple tasks such as cooking.\r\n\r\n“I boil water to cook mealie meal (maize porridge) and the power goes. I can’t eat, it’s a waste. I can’t cope like that,” Motsamai told CNN.\r\n\r\nPump stations can’t provide water and many small businesses without access to backup power are having to close shop and lay off employees, according to people CNN spoke to.\r\n\r\nThando Makhubu runs Soweto Creamery, an ice cream shop in Jabulani, Soweto, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. His family pooled small welfare grants they received during the Covid-19 pandemic to set up the business, but are now feeling the pressure from power outages.\r\n\r\nIn early January, the shop was without power for 72 hours, when electricity did not return as scheduled. Thando was forced to shell out money for diesel to power their generator and prevent all his stock melting. He says the outages are costly and destroying their hopes of expanding.\r\n\r\nBongi Monjanaga, who runs a startup cleaning services company operating across Johannesburg, says the outages affect every part of her fledgling business, such as operating electric cleaning equipment, entering and leaving premises when security gates aren’t functioning, and having internet to invoice clients and complete online tax compliance documents.\r\n\r\n“I find myself in this pool of misery when I’m just trying to start up. I’m just trying to grow,” she says.\r\n\r\nDead chickens, food shortages, higher prices\r\nThe escalation of power outages is also deeply worrying for South Africa’s food security, driving up prices, and placing an even greater strain on stretched household budgets.\r\n\r\nWith modern farming practices ever more reliant on electricity for crop irrigation, processing, and storage, loadshedding is having a huge impact on agricultural output.\r\n\r\nGys Olivier, a farmer from Hertzogville in Free State province, in east-central South Africa, says he and other farmers in the area have been forced to throw away hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of seed potatoes due to disruptions to the ‘cold chain’ – (the process of keeping produce refrigerated throughout the supply chain.)\r\n\r\nThere is also less demand from growers due to water shortages, with pump stations reliant on electricity to operate.\r\n\r\n“We have done everything we can to make sure there is food on the table for a very good price, but it’s become so capital-intensive to farm,” Olivier says.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile livestock and poultry are dying before they even get to the slaughterhouse.\r\n\r\nA gruesome video circulating on social media shows workers removing 50,000 dead broiler chickens from a farm in North West province, the birds suffocated when power outages caused ventilation systems to stop. The financial damage to the farmer was around ZAR1.6m ($93,300) according to local media reports.\r\n\r\nA crime ‘pandemic’\r\nSouth Africa is notorious for high crime rates, and loadshedding is making it worse as home security systems fail when the power goes out, giving criminals a field day inside unsecured properties.\r\nPolicing also becomes harder, with officers unable to reach crime scenes fast enough due to congestion when traffic lights are off.\r\n\r\nTumelo Mogodiseng, General Secretary of the South African Policing Union (SAPU), describes the load-shedding as “a pandemic.”\r\n\r\nHe says his members’ lives are now more at risk, with officers unable to see potentially dangerous situations in the darkness, and police stations, many of which don’t have backup power systems, at risk of attack from criminals during blackouts.\r\n\r\n“Police are dying every day in this country. If this is happening in the daylight, what happens when there is no light for them to see at night?”\r\n\r\nMogodiseng also worries that crimes are going unreported, with citizens fearful of leaving their houses during outages and traveling in the darkness. “Communities won’t travel to police stations to open cases because they are afraid,” he told CNN.\r\n\r\nGareth Newham, who runs the Justice and Violence Prevention Programme at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in Pretoria, says that it’s hard to get solid data on the impact outages are having on crime. While anecdotal evidence suggests criminals are exploiting outages, the recent escalation of loadshedding has coincided with the Christmas holidays, when crime rates typically spike.\r\n\r\nHis biggest concern is that continued loadshedding or a temporary grid collapse could lead to a repeat of the coordinated civil unrest, rioting, and looting in parts of South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces 18 months ago.\r\n\r\n“A complete breakdown in the grid could be the trigger for local level gangs getting more power, and we could see a similar kind of violence to that we saw in July 2021.”\r\n\r\nEskom: The Roots of a Crisis\r\nUnder the ruling African National Congress (ANC), in charge since 1994, Eskom has become synonymous with corruption, crime, and mismanagement.\r\n\r\nLast year a judge-led inquiry into graft under the former president, Jacob Zuma, found that there were grounds to prosecute several former Eskom executives.\r\n\r\nThe government has failed to build new power stations to keep up with increased demand, and warnings from energy experts on looming supply shortages across the past two decades have gone ignored.\r\n\r\nA 2019 report by the South African Institution of Civil Engineering shows skilled engineers have been leaving the country in droves.\r\n\r\nDespite spending billions of USD on two huge coal power stations, neither works properly.\r\n\r\nOlder plants are dilapidated due to a lack of maintenance, and organized crime steals vital coal supplies and cable from the rail lines going from mines to power stations.\r\n\r\nRenewable energy companies say they are desperate to supply to the grid, but the government has been slow to cut red tape and streamline regulatory processes that would reduce the time frame for environmental authorisations, registration of new projects and grid connection approvals.\r\n\r\nLegal challenges against the government and Eskom are stacking up. Several political parties and trade unions say they will take the government and state utility to court for not upholding their duty to provide electricity.\r\n\r\nAdjusting to life in the dark\r\nWith no end in sight to the outages, South Africans are desperate for alternative energy sources, but even they are out of the reach of many citizens.\r\n\r\nThando Makhubu says he was shocked by the cost to power his ice cream business off-grid. “We were quoted R100,000 ($5,945) and that excluded the solar panels.”\r\n\r\nKarin McDonald, who runs a swimming school, similarly found the upfront costs of solar prohibitive. “We received quotes for solar for the business and house and were not looking at anything less than half a million rand ($29,500) which is a major life decision to make,” she said.\r\n\r\nThere is also a long wait for solar. “I know a solar provider that had 40 requests just last week, all for big solar projects, ” said Angus Williamson, a cattle farmer from KwaZulu-Natal province.\r\n\r\nAs they come to terms with their new reality, many South Africans are finding it hard to stay optimistic.\r\n\r\n“The light at the end of the tunnel is a train heading in our direction,” said Williamson.', '230130121911-03-south-africa-power-blackouts.jpg', 'Protests against power blackouts in South Africa', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:14:51', '2023-02-01 01:14:51'),
(7, 'Cities are being cloned in the virtual world. Here’s what that means for the future', 99, 'With space in our cities at a premium, and a majority of the world’s population expected to live in urban areas within the next few decades, there’s less room for trial-and-error when it comes to urban planning – with decisions made today having critical impacts on the future.\r\n\r\nBut what if there was a way to test and analyze different scenarios first, before ever breaking ground? That’s the thinking behind “digital twins” that are being made of cities all over the world, including Shanghai, New York, Singapore and Helsinki.\r\n\r\nDigital twins elevate traditional 3D city models to new possibilities, says Anders Logg, a professor of computational mathematics and director of the Digital Twin Cities Centre at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. Using real-time data and artificial intelligence, digital twins become virtual, living mirrors of their physical counterparts – providing opportunities to simulate everything from infrastructure and construction to traffic patterns and energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga test case\r\nChattanooga, a city of roughly 180,000 people, is nestled in foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, situated almost equidistant from the larger cities of Atlanta, Georgia, to the south and Nashville, Tennessee to the north. While larger urban areas typically get the most attention for their digital twin projects, Chattanooga is a strong test case for the US because its smaller size allows it to be more agile, says Kevin Comstock, consultant with KCI Technologies and former Smart City director for Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nThe city of Chattanooga and its various collaborators, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, have tackled individual issues and areas by creating digital twin projects.\r\n\r\nThe first, called “CTwin,” focused on one of the city’s major roadways to examine mobility-related energy use by building a digital representation of traffic signal infrastructure, says Comstock. Another ongoing project uses sensors and laser imaging at intersections to monitor pedestrian movements and compare it to vehicle traffic, in the interest of safety.\r\n\r\n“If we know where pedestrians are in the intersection, and we know where cars are in the intersection, we can begin to mimic ‘near-miss’ activity,” Comstock says, by tracking pedestrians and bicyclists who alter their course to avoid cars.\r\n\r\nUnlike actual accidents, those near misses aren’t usually reported. Collecting data on them would provide more accurate information on how safe an intersection is, says Comstock, enabling him to figure out how to resolve issues.\r\n\r\nCan this be scaled up for larger cities? “Bigger cities have bigger problems,” says Dr. Ville Lehtola, assistant professor at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. “But it’s also some of the same problems experienced by smaller cities … so if you do the planning well, there will be less risks and the actual operation costs of construction and other operations will be cheaper. Doing better planning pays off.”\r\n\r\nFeeding the digital twin\r\nLehtola is a former city councilor in Espoo, Finland, just outside of Helsinki. He says when a new metro line was proposed, Espoo first digitized the planning of the operations and construction. The digital twin can reveal what the finished job will look like, Lehtola says, “so you could show (the public) for example, if there’s some construction work or land development taking place, what is the outcome, how it will look, and then also get more precision on the estimates on the benefits and useability and added value of different projects.”\r\n\r\nLogg says there are two fundamental questions to answer when creating digital twin cities: “What is analyzed to fit the current state of the city?” and “how can we predict how the city will behave?”\r\n\r\nHe points to Gothenburg, Sweden, which has taken data from sources including regular street maps to generate its digital twin. “From the data you can add things like park benches, the atmosphere, clouds, (and) water,” Logg says, and then use that raw data to create a visual model of how a new building would impact wind patterns, for example, or even potential pitfalls lurking underground.\r\n\r\n“(Gothenburg) is built on clay, so it becomes very important to model the behavior of the clay,” he says. “What happens if you start a new, big infrastructure project? Will there be any potential risk of digging or building new tunnels?”\r\n\r\nThe key to success is what Logg calls “data sustainability” – the frequent, real-time updates feeding into the digital twin to keep pace with the constant evolution of the physical city. Otherwise, he says, the digital twin model “becomes stale.”\r\n\r\nGlobally, investment in digital twins is already starting to pay off. A 2021 report by global tech firm ABI Research estimates cities will save $280 billion by 2030 “by using digital twins for more efficient urban planning.” According to another report from accounting and consulting firm PwC, digital twins can also help with sustainability efforts, one of the original aims of the “smart city” movement.\r\n\r\nData for the future\r\nMore data points are becoming available to inform the models, with sources including autonomous cars, delivery drones, and construction equipment outfitted with smart sensors, Lehtola says. As the technological possibilities increase, so do the challenges, especially with regards to gathering, storing and protecting that much data, he adds.\r\n\r\nBreaking various stakeholders from their individual “silos,” he says, is also important, so the data can be shared and make all facets of city planning more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe technical challenges are considerable, agrees Logg, because cities are extremely complex systems. But, he adds, “those are challenges that we are used to as researchers and developers.”\r\n\r\nLogg sees a future where everything from building maintenance and new construction to roads and traffic signals will be “integrated and connected,” allowing city planners to make decisions that will still make sense decades down the line.\r\n\r\nDigital twins “will be everywhere,” he says, “(as) the system that answers all your questions about future plans.”', '230126104757-01-digital-twin-cities.jpg', 'This digital twin of a city block in Gothenburg, Sweden, shows simulated noise levels from street traffic, visualized by a heat map on the surrounding street and building surfaces.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:17:57', '2023-02-01 01:17:57'),

Starting from February 15, all citizens – including unmarried parents – can register with no ceiling on the number of children.\r\n\r\nIn China, birth registration is often required for parents to access benefits such as maternity insurance. It is also needed to obtain a household registration document, or hukou, that grants children access to social welfare, such as healthcare and education.\r\n\r\nThe Sichuan provincial health commission said in a statement that by scrapping the restriction on marriage, the new measures shifted the focus of birth registration to “the desire and results of childbearing.”\r\n\r\nAn official from the Sichuan health commission told local media that the policy was intended to safeguard the rights of single mothers, not to encourage unmarried people to become parents. The commission’s announcement said the policy would promote “long-term and balanced population development.”\r\n\r\nThe new rules will grant single parents in Sichuan access to benefits previously reserved for married couples, such as maternity insurance that covers prenatal healthcare, childbirth-related medical expenses and paid maternity leave.\r\n\r\nSichuan, home to more than 83 million people, is the fifth most populous province in China.\r\n\r\nIts relaxation of birth registration requirements follow similar steps taken by other provinces, such as Guangdong and Shaanxi.\r\n\r\nChina’s demographic crisis, which is expected to have an increasing impact on growth in the years to come, has been a key concern for policymakers.\r\n\r\nBeijing scrapped its decades-long and highly controversial “one child” policy in 2015, after realizing the restriction had contributed to a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce that could severely distress the country’s economic and social stability.\r\n\r\nTo arrest the falling birth rate, the Chinese government announced in 2015 that it would allow married couples to have two children. But after a brief uptick in 2016, the national birth rate has continued to fall.\r\n\r\nPolicymakers further relaxed limits on births in 2021, allowing three children, and ramped up efforts to encourage larger families, including through a multi-agency plan released last year to strengthen maternity leave and offer tax deductions and other perks to families.

(9, 'The bare-chested boxer who became a hero to Iran’s protest movement', 1, 'The video was instantly viral: Cell phone footage from anti-government protests in Iran’s Kurdish city of Sanandaj showed a bare-chested man wielding a knife, encircled by about a dozen regime forces armed with guns.\r\n\r\nSecurity officers appeared to take turns cautiously swinging their batons at the protester, some even firing their guns at him, as they sprang back and forth with every lunge he made.\r\n\r\nEventually the protester fell to his knees, after being shot multiple times at close range, he says.\r\n\r\nIt was the world’s first glimpse of Ashkan Morovati, a Kurdish Iranian boxer who has since become a hero to supporters of Iran’s protest movement.\r\n\r\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Morovati explained the backstory to the video, taken in late October. In the moments leading up to the confrontation seen on camera, he said, he had approached security forces and asked them to take a calmer approach toward protesters calling for the end of the country’s iron-fisted clerical regime.\r\n\r\n“I went there to tell them to stand by the people and make compromises with people,” Morovati told CNN. “You are suppressing people mercilessly and this is beneath humanity.”\r\n\r\nAs he addressed them, however, the security forces attacked without warning, using pepper spray, batons, and ultimately firing at him, according to Morovati. He says he only took out his knife in self-defense, though to no avail.\r\n\r\n“They shot me with a shotgun from a very close range and then shot me twice with military grade bullets in both legs.”\r\n\r\nIranian authorities did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\r\n\r\nMorovati was arrested and later charged with “waging war against God” or “moharebeh”, a charge that carries the death penalty, and which has been repeatedly used by the Iranian regime to prosecute political protesters in the country.\r\n\r\nThe ordeal could have cost him his life. Instead, it led to his daring escape from Iran.\r\n\r\nClinging to life\r\nIran’s nationwide uprising convulsed the country when it began in mid-September, posing the biggest domestic threat to the ruling clerical class in more than a decade. Mass protests penetrated the regime’s conservative support base and produced countless acts of defiance – and sometimes violence – against the formidable Basij, a voluntary paramilitary group that is the fulcrum of the Islamic Republic’s security apparatus. The protesters were young and angry, and a barrier of fear appeared to have broken.\r\n\r\nBut four months on, a growing wave of repression against demonstrators – including dozens of execution sentences handed out to protesters – has damped Iran’s protests, though not the popular anger behind it. Recent death sentences are the culmination of an increasingly violent crackdown including the gunning down of protesters, mass arrests, physical assault and sexual violence.\r\n\r\nMorovati himself says he died many times before finally escaping from Iran. He alleges that regime forces brutalized him even after his arrest, continuing to beat him and even shooting him again, until they were certain he would not survive.\r\n\r\n“When they were transporting me to hospital, they shot me from a very close range with a shotgun, as if it was a coup de grace,” Morovati explains. He believes that the officers only took him to the hospital because they were certain he would die.\r\n\r\nBut he lived.\r\n\r\nAt Kowsar Hospital in Sanandaj, he was taken to the ICU and treated by several doctors, including Dr. Iman Navabi, a surgeon.\r\n\r\nMorovati told CNN that doctors at the hospital said he had a severed artery in his leg, a lung punctured by shotgun pellets, and about 200 more pellets in his body, with some causing serious wounds.\r\n\r\nThough his condition was dire, he miraculously pulled through.\r\n\r\n“Are you 100%? Open your eyes,” Navabi said in a video posted on his Instagram showing Morovati after surgery. Navabi stood above Morovati, whose large stature lying on a stretcher had his feet dangling off the front end. His parents, visibly worried, sat next to him in hospital gowns.\r\n\r\n“Ashkan Morovati is fine, the operation was successful, his condition is stable, he is out of danger, he is in the ICU tonight and there is nothing to worry about,” Navabi wrote in his video caption.\r\n\r\nMany Iranian doctors and health workers have been arrested as punishment for providing medical treatment for protesters, and after treating Morovati, Navabi himself was arrested in early December, according to Norway-registered Hengaw Organization for Human Rights. He was later released, according to Canadian member of Parliament Terry Beech.\r\n\r\nThe Kurdish boxer, who previously had been seen training with weights, throwing punches and sprinting on videos posted to his social media accounts, spent nearly a month lying in a hospital bed recuperating.\r\n\r\nThen, he says regime forces burst into the hospital and dragged him out in the early hours of November 23.\r\n\r\n“Around 10 plainclothes agents came along with around 20 armed soldiers who had fully taken over the hospital, and took me from the isolated ICU room,” Morovati said, describing the scene. “They had a court order to shoot anyone who came close to interfere and they took me to prison in that condition.”\r\n\r\nHe was taken to prison where he says he experienced unbearable agony because of his open wounds.\r\n\r\nIn prison, Morovati no longer received continual oxygen from an oxygen tank or had his wound dressings changed frequently as he had in the hospital; prison staff ignored his cries of pain, he says.\r\n\r\n“I had to find salt and put them on my wounds to disinfect my wound just a little bit,” Morovati says of his nearly 10 days in prison. “They didn’t pay any attention to my condition.”\r\n\r\nHe relied on fellow prisoners to share their painkillers.\r\n\r\nAfter 10 days, at the persistent urging of his family and pressure from physicians from Kowsar Hospital on the judiciary, prison staff acquiesced in providing medical treatment for Morovati by transferring him to an army hospital.\r\n\r\n“I was there in that condition with both my hands and feet chained to the bed,” Morovati says, describing his six-day tenure at the facility. He says army doctors thought he was dying and suggested he be transferred to a hospital better equipped to treat him.\r\n\r\nAgain, at the behest of family and physician pressure, Morovati was somehow granted reprieve.\r\n\r\n“They gave me 20 days to get myself to a well-equipped hospital,” he says.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time that the judiciary charged him with moharebe – without a hearing and without questioning. And this was precisely the time that Morovati took advantage of to make his great escape.\r\n\r\nA narrow escape\r\nInstead of going to a hospital, Morovati fled the country, traveling overland. “I got out of the country through mountains and deserts while heavily bleeding and in a very, very bad condition,” Morovati says.\r\n\r\nWith the help of friends, he says he is now in a safe place, in an undisclosed location outside of Iran’s borders.\r\n\r\n“Many people in Iran are dying to get out of the country and tell the world the truth,” Morovati explains. “Our only crime is that we demand freedom and democracy and want our women to be equal to our men. We shouted ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ – this is our crime.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked if Iranians are scared in light of the current crackdown on protesters, Morovati disagreed, referencing a popular slogan used by protesters: “Any one person who is killed, there are a thousand people in support of them.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe that people are scared,” Morovati says. “People are still standing bravely and will [continue to] stand courageously.”\r\n\r\nMorovati still hasn’t received medical attention since his escape and says his leg that sustained the gunshot wound is numb, but he copes with it. He says it’s extremely painful for him to come to terms with the fact that he won’t be able to pursue boxing as a career after his injuries, but his hopes lie in a different destiny now.\r\n\r\nAsked about his safety and any physical pain he feels, Morovati hastily responds saying he doesn’t feel safe, and he is in pain. He quickly adds that “the most important thing for me right now is Iran’s liberation.”\r\n\r\n“I will give my life for my people, for my Iran, not one time, but a hundred thousand times,” he added.', '230130194834-03-ashkan-morovati.jpg', 'Ashkan Morovati trains in the boxing ring.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:30:19', '2023-02-01 01:30:19');

(11, '‘The enemy is always looking for us’: Hidden in the forest, Ukraine’s drone operators are crucial to the eastern battle', 1, 'The pine forests near the city of Kreminna have become one of the hottest combat zones in the war in eastern Ukraine. Almost every weapon seems to be at work here, artillery, howitzers, tanks and mortars. But perhaps the most important is the smallest: The reconnaissance drone.\r\n\r\nUkrainian and Russian forces have been fighting here for nearly two months. If the Ukrainians can break through Russian lines and reach Kreminna, they can disrupt Russian supply routes.\r\n\r\nBut it’s a much tougher proposition than it was at the end of last year. Russia’s defensive lines have been reinforced with heavy weapons and long-range artillery.\r\n\r\nCNN accompanied two Ukrainian drone operators from the Dnipro-1 battalion deep into the forest to see how they operate. The journey was along tracks of soft sand amid a thin canopy of pine trees, through an eerie landscape dotted with streams and bogs.\r\n\r\nA year ago, one of the drone operators, who gave his name only as Ruslan, was a snowboard and kayak instructor. Now he’s watching the movement of Russian armor along the forest tracks, expertly skimming his drone across the treetops.\r\n\r\nArriving at a foxhole, the drone operators’ vehicles are carefully maneuvered under tree cover. The Russians have reconnaissance drones too, and Ukrainian drone operators are regarded as high-value targets.\r\n\r\nRuslan points to the east and north: the Russians were 7 kilometers (4 miles) away in one direction and 3 kilometers in the other.\r\n\r\nA Mavic-3 drone – the workhorse of Ukrainian reconnaissance, even if it weighs less than a kilogram and has a span of just 35 centimeters (14 inches) – ascends with a whir from a nearby clearing. It can remain aloft for about 45 minutes and travel up to 30 kilometers in total, feeding high-definition video back to the operators.\r\n\r\nTheir job is to provide real-time intelligence on Russian positions and movements, and also to help Ukrainian artillery fix targets. Hidden among the woods are emplacements of 120mm and 82mm artillery, and somewhere nearby a massive Krab 155 mm howitzer, one of about 50 donated by Poland. The Ukrainians like the Krab for its accuracy and power, but it is demanding to maintain.\r\n\r\n“This is artillery battle all day,” Ruslan says.\r\n\r\nHe’s not exaggerating. There are few moments of silence during the hour CNN is with Ruslan and his colleague. Artillery shells launched from a nearby Ukrainian emplacement make a deafening roar. The crump of Russian shelling echoes in the distance.\r\n\r\n“The last month, the Russian army are here more and more,” Ruslan says. “The overall line is static but all the time the positions change. Sometimes the Russians go (forward) and sometimes our army goes.”\r\n\r\nThat means firefights in the thick of the forest. But it also means that Ukraine is getting through its artillery munitions fast. Trucks rumble through the nearby village of Yampil with fresh supplies, but Ruslan says Ukraine needs much more artillery ammunition here.\r\n\r\nIn the nearby village of Zarichne, just beyond the forest fringe, Russian artillery targets a rickety bridge every day. There is not much of the village left standing: Those remaining here are mainly the elderly and the destitute. They either can’t or won’t leave.\r\n\r\nOne of them – a 69-year-old who gives her name as Valentina – tells CNN the Russians shell the village all the time.\r\n\r\n“It is dangerous but what can we do? We endure. Sometimes we hide. But now it is too cold in the basement, you can freeze to death there,” she says.\r\n\r\n“Look at my windows, there is no glass remaining. Just wood and plastic we used to cover them. And it’s cold.”\r\n\r\nShe looks down the street wistfully, as if remembering better times.\r\n\r\nValentina’s daughter is far away in Dnipro, central Ukraine, but she won’t quit her home to join her. After all, she has planted potatoes. “I won’t abandon them,” she says with a tired smile.\r\n\r\nZarichne – like large swathes of this region – was occupied by the Russians for much of last year before being liberated by Ukrainian forces in the fall. But liberation came in name only. The slopes and forests beyond echo to the impact of rockets and shells. Ukrainian units are dug in among the pines and sand nearby, where unexploded ordnance litters the forest floor.\r\n\r\nA few miles away, the Dnipro-1 battalion has its own drone workshop, where NATO-issue grenades are carefully sawn in half to be reconstituted as small, free-fall munitions. Under a table sits a slab of C-4 plastic explosive. It’s a painstaking and demanding process, churning out one a handmade munition every 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nSome of the unit’s drone munitions are essentially fragment grenades dropped on infantry – and especially fighters from the Russian private military contractor Wagner fighters around Bakhmut. Heavier versions can damage or disable a tank.\r\n\r\nThe commander of Dnipro-1’s drone unit goes by the name of Graf. He says that drones have become “one of the most important elements of this war – both for us and the enemy. Nothing can be executed without drones.”\r\n\r\nAnd that makes his men targets. “At the moment the drone operator is one of the most dangerous jobs. The enemy knows we are the eyes of our army. As soon as they locate a drone operator, they use all kinds of weaponry: barrel artillery, MLRS, tanks,” Graf says.\r\n\r\n“We have high rate of casualties among the pilots, the enemy is always looking for us.” Graf says.\r\n\r\nNo Ukrainian soldier on this front is under the illusion that this conflict will be won soon. Across the eastern Donbas region, brutal, attritional battles are unfolding: Gains and losses are measured in hundreds of meters.\r\n\r\nGraf echoes what every Ukrainian soldier says seems to say. “Now we are receiving tanks – so we need more tanks. And we need aviation and long-range missiles. We have to destroy the enemy on its approach to Ukraine. That’s the only way to win.”\r\n\r\nAnd for his unit, Graf dreams of getting US Predator attack drones. That’s not under consideration in Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Ruslan and his colleagues hold the line – and in Zarichne, Valentina prays for them.\r\n\r\n“God damn those Russians coming to other people’s land!” she says. “I stand for Ukraine, I was born here, my ancestors are from here, I always was pro-Ukraine and always will be.”', '230130155055-05-ukraine-drone-operators-kremmina.jpg', 'Camoflage is seen hanging on a line in a ruined building in the village of Zarichne, eastern Ukraine.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:41:47', '2023-02-01 01:41:47'),

Five civil servants were authorized to accompany him to Miami from January 1 to 30.\r\n\r\nHis presence in Florida has drawn criticism by House Democrats, who in mid-January urged US President Joe Biden not to “provide shelter” for Bolsonaro in the wake of his supporters storming Brazil’s democratic institutions in the capital Brasilia – an attack that has drawn comparisons to the US Capitol riots on January 6, 2021.\r\n\r\nThe former leader denounced the attack, but experts say his repeated and unfounded claims of election fraud in the run-up to October’s election served to foment anger among his supporters. Before Sunday’s violence, they had camped out for months in the capital and security outside the congressional building was fortified due to their presence.\r\n\r\nOn January 13, Brazil’s Supreme Court accepted a request from the public prosecutor’s office to have Bolsonaro investigated for alleged involvement in the January 8 attacks in Brasilia.\r\n\r\nCNN has reached out to AG Immigration for comment.', '230130144342-bolsonaro-june-2022.jpg', 'Bolsonaro looks on after a ceremony about the National Policy for Education at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil June 20, 2022.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:44:45', '2023-02-01 01:44:45'),
(13, 'Maryland bill would subsidize employers that try a 4-day workweek', 5, 'In a first-of-its-kind proposal in the United States, some Maryland lawmakers want to subsidize employers that choose to experiment with a 4-day workweek.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, it would subsidize employers that agree to try out a 32-hour workweek without reducing their full-time employees’ weekly pay, which is based on 40 hours of work.\r\n\r\nIn February, legislators in Maryland’s Democratic-controlled House and Senate will hold hearings on a bill that would offer state tax credits to companies that take up that challenge.\r\n\r\n“The pandemic has taught us that how we view work is not set in stone but it’s something that we as citizens can control,” said Maryland Delegate Vaughn Stewart, one of the bill’s lead sponsors.\r\n\r\nWhile many 4-day workweek experiments have been conducted recently in the US and Europe, no US state has offered to subsidize the cost of the experiment for its employers, Stewart added.\r\n\r\nEmployers that participate would have flexibility over how they allow workers to organize their shorter workweek, Stewart said. For some companies, eight hours a day for four days might work best. At other firms, some employees might prefer to work five days a week but end their days at an earlier hour to attend to their commitments outside of work.\r\n\r\n“We’re not trying to prescribe to companies how they do it,” he said. “It may be more advantageous to have different approaches.”\r\n\r\nThe experiment should include both blue-collar and white-collar employers, Stewart added. “This is not just for corporate entities.”\r\n\r\nTo qualify for the credit, employers would have to participate in the program for no less than one year and no more than two. They would have to share data on their program’s results with Maryland’s Department of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe bill in its current form caps what the state would spend in total on program participants’ credits at $750,000 a year for five years. So if there is huge interest by employers, Maryland’s Department of Labor will have to select which ones may participate. In addition, the state would have to pay the costs to administer the program, which Stewart estimates might come in at $250,000 a year.\r\n\r\nStewart views the credit as a carrot to compensate employers for participating in what he hopes will be groundbreaking labor research at the state level.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the success of prior experiments\r\nThe immediate impetus to introduce the bill in Maryland, Stewart said, was a recent report on the results of a shorter workweek trial for 903 employees at 33 different companies.\r\n\r\nThat trial, coordinated by the nonprofit 4 Day Week Global, along with researchers at Boston College, University College Dublin and Cambridge University, found that the majority of the companies experienced a boost in productivity and revenue, and most of the workers involved reported less stress, fatigue and burnout. And importantly, most participating companies said they didn’t plan to return to a five-day workweek.\r\n\r\nSince none of the companies in that trial were specific to Maryland, Stewart said, “We want Maryland employers to experience the same productivity and profit gains.” And, he noted, it would help employees in the state to have more time for their lives outside of work.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he’s confident the bill would pass both chambers of the state’s legislature before the end of the Maryland General Assembly’s 2023 session on April 10, Stewart said he is “cautiously optimistic.” He added that he’s gotten more interest in this bill than in all the other bills he’s sponsored combined since he became a member of Maryland’s House of Delegates in January 2019.', '230131104344-maryland-4-day-workweek-restricted.jpg', 'Maryland bill would subsidize employers that try a 4-day workweek', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:47:20', '2023-02-01 01:47:20'),

Reed has also brought another amended defamation complaint against a number of golf journalists and media organizations.\r\n\r\nMcIlroy, who has previously criticized LIV Golf for “ripping apart” men’s professional golf, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request asking for more details about the subpoena.\r\n\r\n“I’m living in reality, I don’t know where he’s [Reed] living,” said McIlroy, ahead of the Dubai tournament.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t see a tee coming my direction at all, but apparently that’s what happened. And if roles were reversed and I’d have of thrown that tee at him, I’d be expecting him [to file] a lawsuit,” added McIlroy.\r\n\r\n‘Treegate’\r\nThe duo were level on the leaderboard at the halfway stage of the event, tied two shots shy of the leading pack, before an electric third round from McIlroy saw him take a commanding three-stroke advantage into the final day.\r\n\r\nReed returned to the clubhouse Sunday four shots adrift of the leader, yet not before being embroiled in another controversy.\r\n\r\n‘Teegate’ became ‘Treegate’ following an incident at the 17th hole of the 2018 Masters’ winners round, whereby his opening drive nestled in a palm tree.\r\n\r\nA binocular search by rule officials and Reed ensued to find the ball, with the golfer potentially having to go back to tee should the ball fail to be identified.\r\n\r\nCiting his unique markings on the ball, Reed could be heard on TV broadcasts telling officials he was “100%” certain that the correct ball had been located and was subsequently given a penalty drop from the base of the palm.\r\n\r\nHowever subsequent TV replays appeared to show that the ball had settled in a different tree. Reed went on to bogey the par-four hole.\r\n\r\n“I hit that tee shot, I didn’t even see those palms,” Reed told reporters regarding the incident.\r\n\r\n“It’s an unfortunate break, but at the same time I hit the line solid. I hit it right down the line I was looking. That’s all you’re going to ask for. You’re going to get bad breaks once in a while. You just have to bounce back from them.”\r\n\r\nA statement released by the DP World Tour said: “Two on-course referees and several marshals identified that Patrick Reed’s ball had become lodged in a specific tree following his tee shot on 17.\r\n\r\n“The DP World Tour chief referee joined the player in the area and asked him to identify his distinctive ball markings. Using binoculars, the chief referee was satisfied that a ball with those markings was lodged in the tree.\r\n\r\n“To clarify, the player was not asked to specify the tree but to identify his distinctive ball markings to confirm it was his ball,” the statement added.\r\n\r\nMcIlroy’s sweet success\r\nPlaying in a LIV Golf cap, Reed needed a fast start to the final round and delivered emphatically, rattling off five birdies and an eagle to hunt down and nudge ahead of McIlroy at the 13th hole.\r\n\r\nAn instant birdie response from the World No. 1, playing a hole behind, set up a grandstand finish at the Majlis course.\r\n\r\nWhen Reed finally faltered at the 16th, missing his par putt to register his only bogey of the round, McIlroy took full advantage with a birdie at the penultimate hole.\r\n\r\nKnowing he needed to repeat the feat to avoid a playoff, Northern Irishman McIlroy rolled home from 14 feet as a stone-faced Reed watched on via a clubhouse TV screen.\r\n\r\nAn emphatic roar and fist pump followed from McIlroy before his on-green interview. Quizzed on whether the week’s earlier incidents had motivated him, the four-time major champion did not explicitly name Reed but admitted the win was “sweeter than it should be or needs to be.”\r\n\r\n“I think mentally today was probably one of the toughest rounds I’ve ever had to play because it would be really easy to let your emotions get in the way,” said McIlroy.\r\n\r\n“I just had to really concentrate on focusing on myself, forget who was up there on the leaderboard, and I did that really, really well.”', '230131160204-mcilroy-reed-card.jpg', 'Rory McIlroy and Patrick Reed are pictured together at the Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village Golf Club in June 2022.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 01:51:45', '2023-02-01 01:51:45'),

With their range of 185 kilometers (115 miles), they will more than double the current range of the missiles on Australia’s ships, the Australian Defense Ministry said in a statement last April, when first announcing the purchase.\r\n\r\nThursday’s statement said the Naval Strike Missiles will begin replacing Harpoon missiles on Australian warships in 2024, while the HIMARS would be in the Australian arsenal by 2026-27.\r\n\r\nSome Australian military analysts said Thursday’s announcement was largely for political reasons, as both had been announced by a right-leaning government that was voted out of office in favor of a left-leaning government last May 21.\r\n\r\n“I assume there’s a deeper political message to show that the new left-leaning government … is keen on defense spending,” said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and former Royal Australian Air Force officer.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of the HIMARS system, which is focused on land-based warfare, may be a way to keep the votes of army supporters as the much of Australia’s defense focus has been on China, including with its plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines in the AUKUS arrangement with the United States and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n“The Australian Army is in search of a role now the Middle Eastern wars have finished,” said Layton. “They are unable to find a place for themselves given Australia’s current strategic circumstances which favor air and naval force.”\r\n\r\nIan Hall, deputy director of research at Griffith Asia, said a role for the HIMARS was being debated in the country.\r\n\r\n“I imagine that HIMARS could be used in a contingency in Southeast Asia or even somewhere in the Pacific,” he said, pointing out that the US Marines have been exercising with HIMARS with the thought of deploying them to Pacific islands in the event of hostilities in the region.', '230105114339-file-himars-system.jpg', 'A US M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) fires a missile during annual combat drills between the Philippine Marine Corps and US Marine Corps in Capas, Philippines, on October 13, 2022.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 02:36:02', '2023-02-01 02:36:02');

(23, 'Academy will not rescind Andrea Riseborough’s Oscar nomination', 4, 'British actress Andrea Riseborough will get to keep her Oscar nomination for best lead actress for her performance in the independent drama “To Leslie,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nLast week, The Academy launched a “review of the campaign procedures around this year’s nominees,” and though Riseborough and the film were not named as cause for the review, the celebrity-backed grassroots campaign that earned the actress a surprise nomination was thought to be at least partially cause for the examination.\r\n\r\nIn a statement to CNN on Tuesday, Bill Kramer, CEO of the Academy, confirmed that “concerns” about the “To Leslie” awards campaign that resulted in Riseborough’s nomination prompted an investigation into film’s “campaign tactics.”\r\n\r\nUltimately, the statement said, “The Academy has determined the activity in question does not rise to the level that the film’s nomination should be rescinded.”\r\n\r\n“However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern,” the statement added. “These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly.”\r\n\r\n“To Leslie” follows the story of an alcoholic single mother (Riseborough) who wins the lottery but runs out of money. It premiered at South by Southwest in March and while Riseborough’s performance earned critical acclaim, the film only made $27,000 at the box office during its limited release.\r\n\r\nBut some big-name Hollywood figures agreed with critics and stars like Gwyneth Paltrow, Amy Adams, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Aniston were vocal in their support for Riseborough on social media (sometimes in eyebrow-raising similar language) and via other venues – like Q&As and screenings.\r\n\r\nThe Academy’s statement did not specify which rules may or may not have been broken in the course of the campaigning that took place on the film’s behalf.\r\n\r\n“The purpose of the Academy’s campaign regulations is to ensure a fair and ethical awards process—these are core values of the Academy,” Kramer said in his statement. “Given this review, it is apparent that components of the regulations must be clarified to help create a better framework for respectful, inclusive, and unbiased campaigning.”\r\n\r\nHe added that “changes will be made after this awards cycle” and shared with members of the Academy.\r\n\r\nRiseborough’s “To Leslie” costar Marc Maron was among those who decried the Academy’s review, scathingly saying that the film’s success “threatens their system,” which is “completely bought out by corporate interests in the form of studios.”\r\n\r\nThought-to-be contenders Danielle Deadwyler (“Till”) and Viola Davis (“The Woman King”) were among those who were shut out of the best actress category this year.\r\n\r\nRiseborough is joined in the category by Michelle Williams (“The Fablemans”), Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”), Ana de Armas (“Blonde”) and Cate Blanchett (“Tár”).\r\n\r\nThe voting window for the Oscars runs from March 2 through March 7. The Oscars will take place on March 12.\r\n\r\n“The Academy strives to create an environment where votes are based solely on the artistic and technical merits of the eligible films and achievements,” Kramer’s statement added.', '230131171413-riseborough-to-leslie-screening.jpg', '“I assume there’s a deeper political message to show that the new left-leaning government … is keen on defense spending,” said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and former Royal Australian Air Force officer.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of the HIMARS system, which is focused on land-based warfare, may be a way to keep the votes of army supporters as the much of Australia’s defense focus has been on China, including with its plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines in the AUKUS arrangement with the United States and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n“The Australian Army is in search of a role now the Middle Eastern wars have finished,” said Layton. “They are unable to find a place for themselves given Australia’s current strategic circumstances which favor air and naval force.”\r\n\r\nIan Hall, deputy director of research at Griffith Asia, said a role for the HIMARS was being debated in the country.\r\n\r\n“I imagine that HIMARS could be used in a contingency in Southeast Asia or even somewhere in the Pacific,” he said, pointing out that the US Marines have been exercising with HIMARS with the thought of deploying them to Pacific islands in the event of hostilities in the region.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 02:36:41', '2023-02-01 02:36:54'),

Attorneys for both defendants previously insisted their respective clients are innocent.\r\n\r\n“Negligent use of a deadly weapon charges were also filed against ‘Rust’ assistant director David Halls, who has pleaded no contest and has entered into a plea agreement that is pending approval,” according to a media statement issued by the DA’s office.\r\n\r\n“Today we have taken another important step in securing justice for Halyna Hutchins,” District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. “In New Mexico, no one is above the law and justice will be served.”\r\n\r\nCarmack-Altwies told CNN earlier this month she would charge Baldwin and the film’s armorer with involuntary manslaughter, accusing them of failing to perform safety procedures that could have prevented the accident that resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\r\n\r\nHutchins was struck and killed by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun being held by Baldwin, who maintains he did not pull the gun’s trigger.\r\n\r\nDirector Joel Souza was also shot and injured.\r\n\r\nBaldwin did not take firearm training on the “Rust” movie set seriously, prosecutors said in probable cause documents outlining evidence in the case.\r\n\r\n“A training session for at least an hour or more in length was scheduled, but the actual training consisted of only approximately 30 minutes as according to (armorer Hannah Gutierrez) Reed, Baldwin was distracted and talking on his cell phone to his family during the training,” the document states.\r\n\r\nGutierrez Reed is also charged with involuntary manslaughter, with prosecutors stating she did not insist on Baldwin’s safety training, did not check each round loaded into the firearms, and did not follow appropriate safety protocols in storing ammunition.\r\n\r\n“Gutierrez Reed was reckless in her responsibility to ensure set safety with the firearm. She failed to correct Baldwin from committing the dangerous and reckless safety violations by pointing the weapon at/towards people and by having his finger on the trigger,” according to the probable cause statement against Gutierrez Reed.\r\n\r\n“The photos and videos clearly show Baldwin, multiple times, with his finger inside\r\n\r\nof the trigger guard and on the trigger, while manipulating the hammer and while drawing, pointing, and holstering the revolver,” prosecutors said.\r\n\r\nRepeated FBI testing on the weapon determined it could not fire without the trigger being pressed. In interviews with CNN and ABC Baldwin has claimed he did not pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nCNN has reached out to representatives for both Baldwin and Gutierrrez Reed.\r\n\r\nBaldwin has maintained he was not aware the gun he fired during a rehearsal contained a live round. In a statement to CNN on Jan. 19, his attorney called the prosecutors’ decision “a terrible miscarriage of justice.”\r\n\r\n“This decision distorts Halyna Hutchins’ tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice. Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun – or anywhere on the movie set,” Baldwin’s attorney Luke Nikas said in his statement.\r\n\r\n“He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds. We will fight these charges, and we will win.”\r\n\r\nAn attorney for Gutierrez Reed said he believes jurors will find his client not guilty.\r\n\r\n“We were expecting the charges but they’re absolutely wrong as to Hannah – we expect that she will be found not guilty by a jury and she did not commit manslaughter,” attorney Jason Bowles said in a statement to CNN earlier this month when the indictment was first released.\r\n\r\n“She has been emotional about the tragedy but has committed no crime.”\r\n\r\nBaldwin and Gutierrez Reed each face two counts of involuntary manslaughter so that a jury can decide which specific count may be more appropriate, Carmack-Altwies previously told CNN.\r\n\r\nIf convicted, “they will only be sentenced to one count,” the prosecutor said.\r\n\r\nIn either case, a conviction is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and up to a $5,000 fine, prosecutors said.\r\n\r\nBut one count would involve a firearm enhancement, or an added penalty, because a firearm was involved.

(25, '‘Pamela, a love story’ works to help Pamela Anderson reclaim her narrative', 4, 'The word “Intimate” is frequently used when describing celebrity documentaries, but it certainly applies to “Pamela, a love story,” which at one point shows Pamela Anderson lounging in the bathtub as portions of her diaries are read as voiceover. The result is a humanizing look at a woman often reduced to cartoon caricature, while occasionally feeling too conspicuously like a licensed product.\r\n\r\nProduced by, among others, Anderson’s son Brandon Thomas Lee, director Ryan White (whose biographical documentaries include “Ask Dr. Ruth” and “Serena”) had access not only to her diaries but a collection of home movies – including, yes, the one stolen and posted for the world to see, of Anderson having sex with her then-husband, drummer Tommy Lee.\r\n\r\nAnderson, now 55, speaks at length of that interlude, the invasiveness of having private material shown and exploited in that fashion, and what she clearly sees as a reopening of those wounds with Hulu’s limited series “Pam & Tommy,” which dramatized those events.\r\n\r\nAnderson’s account actually does little to detract from that Emmy-nominated production, which was quite sympathetic in portraying the hurt she felt and the way the media treated her. Indeed, the clips presented here of late-night comics cashing in on Anderson as a punchline, or interviewers Matt Lauer and Larry King asking her about her breasts, do as much to endorse the Hulu version as undermine it.\r\n\r\n“Pamela” makes clear that Anderson is letting her guard down right from the outset, as she appears makeup-free, hanging out in the small British Columbia town where she grew up, before getting discovered at a football game (fans “oohed” when she appeared on the scoreboard camera) launched her as a model and into the pages of Playboy.\r\n\r\nAs Anderson tells it, during that time she reclaimed her sexuality, having experienced abuse on more than one occasion as a child.\r\n\r\nInternational stardom on “Baywatch” followed, and it’s amusing to hear Anderson reminisce not only about all the celebrities she dated during that stretch, but the whole “Running on the beach in slow motion” imagery. (There’s no mention of “Home Improvement,” or Anderson’s recent allegations in her memoir of being flashed by its star, Tim Allen, which the comic has denied.)\r\n\r\nThe indignities of that “blond bombshell” status are nicely documented here. Ditto for the intrusions of the paparazzi, who dogged her particularly after the whirlwind romance with Lee.\r\n\r\nThe feeding frenzy surrounding the sex tape “solidified the cartoon image” of her, Anderson recalls, adding, “I knew at that point my career was over.”\r\n\r\nWhile “Pamela” handles all of that quite well, too much of the rest of it plays like the Hallmark Card version of Anderson’s story, from the cloying, saccharine music to the interviews with her sons, whose protectiveness toward their mother is admirable but not especially enlightening.\r\n\r\nThe last part of the documentary also feels a bit scattered, venturing into areas like Anderson’s animal-rights activism through PETA, her advocacy for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and, finally, her Broadway debut in “Chicago.”\r\n\r\nAt its best, “Pamela, a love story” strips away what in hindsight looks like misogynistic media coverage – obsessed with her looks and relationships – to consider the person behind all of that, while proving a little too determined and pliable in the goal of helping Anderson assert ownership over her narrative.\r\n\r\nAt those moments, “Pamela” might work as a love story, but it fares a little less well as a documentary.\r\n\r\n“Pamela, a love story” premieres January 31 on Netflix.', '230126150439-01-pamela-a-love-story-netflix.jpg', 'Pamela Anderson opens up in the Netflix documentary \"Pamela, a love story.\"', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 02:38:28', '2023-02-01 02:38:28'),
(26, 'Questions are swirling around Andrea Riseborough’s Oscar nomination', 4, 'Andrea Riseborough may not be a name that rings many bells for the average moviegoer.\r\n\r\nBut, chances are, your favorite actor in that one movie you love knows exactly who she is. And they want her to win an Oscar.\r\n\r\nIt’s, frankly, a strange tale – one that began in October with the limited release of a small-time independent film called “To Leslie,” about what happens when a single mother wins the lottery and runs out of money. Riseborough plays the titular Leslie, in a performance widely praised by critics as some of the best work of her career.\r\n\r\nAnd just last week, Riseborough was nominated for a best actress Academy Award, her first Oscar nomination.\r\n\r\nBut there are questions surrounding her nomination, which came after a very public push by multiple big-time Hollywood stars – think Gwyneth Paltrow and Amy Adams. Now, without specifically mentioning Riseborough or “To Leslie,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says it is investigating this year’s campaign procedures to ensure no rules were broken. (Contacting Academy members to promote a film or push for an award is forbidden.)\r\n\r\nSo dim the lights and cue the suspenseful music. Here’s everything you need to know:\r\n\r\n‘To Leslie’ released to critical acclaim, but not wide appeal\r\nUntil recently, most Americans hadn’t heard of “To Leslie.” Premiering at South by Southwest in March, the film made just $27,000 at the box office during its limited release.\r\n\r\nThis month, that changed when some of the biggest names in film threw their weight behind the movie. Paltrow praised the film on Instagram, saying Riseborough should win every award, including “all the ones that haven’t been invented yet.”\r\n\r\nAdams hosted a conversation with Riseborough and director Michael Morris, calling the movie an “amazing, amazing feat of filmmaking.”\r\n\r\nKate Winslet, Jennifer Aniston, Edward Norton and Charlize Theron have all also publicly supported the film in various ways, through screenings or moderated discussions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on Twitter, other actors have posted almost identical statements supporting the film, calling it a “small film with a giant heart.” Some have likened it to a copy-and-paste job.\r\n\r\nRiseborough’s grassroots-esque campaign isn’t new\r\nThough a celebrity-backed campaign isn’t strictly a grassroots effort, the push for Riseborough and “To Leslie” is akin to one. Rarely do celebrities come out with this type of support for a film they don’t star in, making Riseborough’s rapid ascent unique.\r\n\r\nBut this isn’t the first time an actor has publicly attempted an Oscars push on their own. A decade ago, actress Melissa Leo staged her own photoshoot and took out her own “For Your Consideration” advertisements. Leo at the time was nominated for best supporting actress for her role in 2010’s “The Fighter.”\r\n\r\n“This entire awards process, to some degree, is about pimping yourself out,” she told the New York Times in 2011. Leo went on to win the award.\r\n\r\nIndustry-watchers have noted that soliciting votes is often done to level a playing field – in this case, bring attention to a small-budget, little-known film. The difference now is social media, making this push public rather than one done behind closed doors.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, not every actor has the kind of connections Riseborough does. Critics of the nominations have pointed out that Viola Davis (“The Woman King”) and Danielle Deadwyler (“Till”), two Black actresses who were considered frontrunners, were not nominated for the award. (Both films also drew larger audiences to the box office.)\r\n\r\nThe Academy’s diversity problem has long been discussed and dissected. And while Riseborough is not at fault for the snubs, some have pointed out that the campaign behind her displays just how much of an advantage it is to have famous White friends.\r\n\r\nThe Academy’s investigation has more people talking\r\nOn Friday, the Academy announced a “review of the campaign procedures around this year’s nominees,” according to a statement obtained by CNN.\r\n\r\nThe Academy didn’t specifically mention Riseborough, or the very public celebrity push for her nomination. But many people are connecting those dots.\r\n\r\nChristina Ricci, star of the Emmy-nominated show “Yellowjackets,” called the Academy’s decision to review the procedures “very backward,” in a now-deleted Instagram post.\r\n\r\n“Seems hilarious that the ‘surprise nomination’ (meaning tons of money wasn’t spent to position this actress) of a legitimately brilliant performance is being met with an investigation,” she wrote, according to Deadline. “So it’s only the films and actors that can afford the campaigns that deserve recognition? Feels elitist and exclusive.”\r\n\r\nWhether Riseborough’s nomination will actually be overturned is hard to say. There is precedent – in 2014, composer Bruce Broughton received an Oscar nomination for the title song from “Alone Yet Not Alone” and was later disqualified over his campaign.\r\n\r\nRegardless of celebrity backing, Riseborough faces fierce competition in the category, from the likes of Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) and Cate Blanchett (Tár).\r\n\r\nAs the melee plays out, one thing is for sure: you’re gonna need more popcorn.', '230130131603-andrea-riseborough-to-leslie.jpg', 'Riseborough in \"To Leslie.\"', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 02:40:09', '2023-02-01 02:40:09'),

(32, 'Ticketmaster gets grilled: 6 takeaways from hearing over Taylor Swift concert fiasco', 5, 'Lawmakers grilled a top executive of Ticketmaster’s parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, on Tuesday after the service’s inability to process orders for Taylor Swift’s upcoming tour left millions of people unable to buy tickets late last year.\r\n\r\nDuring the three-hour hearing, senators pressed Live Nation president and CFO Joe Berchtold and some other witnesses on whether his company was too dominant in the industry, thereby harming rivals, musicians and fans.\r\n\r\n“I want to congratulate and thank you for an absolutely stunning achievement,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal said to Berthtold. “You have brought together Republicans and Democrats in an absolutely unified cause.”\r\n\r\nHere’s a look at the big takeaways from the hearing:\r\n\r\nBlaming it on the bots\r\nWhen tickets for Swift’s new five-month Eras Tour went on sale on Ticketmaster in mid November, heavy demand snarled the ticketing site, infuriating fans who couldn’t snag tickets. Unable to resolve the problems, Ticketmaster subsequently canceled Swift’s concert ticket sales to the general public, citing “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand.”\r\n\r\nIn his testimony Tuesday, Berchtold partly blamed the Swift ticketing incident on the bots.\r\n\r\nTicketmaster, he said, was “hit with three times the amount of bot traffic than we had ever experienced” amid the “unprecedented demand for Taylor Swift tickets.” The bot activity “required us to slow down and even pause our sales. This is what led to a terrible consumer experience that we deeply regret.”\r\n\r\nBerchtold also went on defense more broadly about his company. He emphasized that Ticketmaster does not set ticket prices, does not determine the number of tickets put up for sale and that “in most cases, venues set service and ticketing fees,” not Ticketmaster.\r\n\r\nHe also rejected suggestions that its dominance has allowed for soaring fees, citing data from the market intelligence firm Pollstar showing that Live Nation controls about 200 out of approximately 4,000 venues in the United States, or about 5%.\r\n\r\nThe venues controlled by Live Nation set fees that are “consistent with the other venues in the marketplace,” he said.\r\n\r\nEntertainment industry pushes back at Ticketmaster’s dominance\r\nMembers of the entertainment industry and one rival spoke out against Ticketmaster’s dominance in the industry.\r\n\r\nJack Groetzinger, CEO of SeatGeek, alleged that many venue owners “fear losing Live Nation concerts if they don’t use Ticketmaster” and its services, and argued the company must be broken up.\r\n\r\n“Live Nation controls the most popular entertainers in the world, routes most of the large tours, operates the ticketing systems and even owns many of the venues,” he told lawmakers. “This power over the entire live entertainment industry allows Live Nation to maintain its monopolistic influence over the primary ticketing market.”\r\n\r\nHe continued: “As long as Live Nation remains both the dominant concert promoter and ticketer of major venues in the US, the industry will continue to lack competition and struggle,” he said.\r\n\r\nClyde Lawrence, a singer-songwriter on the witness panel, explained how the company acts as a promoter, a venue and the ticketing company, which eats into performing artists’ revenues. Artists, he said, have no leverage over Live Nation.\r\n\r\n“Since both our pay and theirs is a share of the show’s profits, we should be true partners aligned in our incentives — keep costs low while ensuring the best fan experience,” he said. “But with Live Nation not only acting as the promoter but also the owner and operator of the venue, it seriously complicates these incentives.”\r\n\r\nLawrence also said with Ticketmaster, “we’ll see a 40%-ish or closer to 50% fee added on top” of the base ticket price.\r\n\r\nThe fallout from the ticketing fiasco once again cast a harsh spotlight on Ticketmaster and its power in the industry, more than a decade after it completed its merger with Live Nation despite concerns the deal would create a near monopoly in the ticketing sector.\r\n\r\n“To have a strong capitalist system, you have to have competition,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said during her opening remarks. “You can’t have too much consolidation — something that, unfortunately for this country, as an ode to Taylor Swift, I will say, we know ‘all too well.’”\r\n\r\nConsumers may pay the price, too\r\nKathleen Bradish, vice president for legal advocacy at the American Antitrust Institute, called Ticketmaster “a very traditional monopoly” and told lawmakers the lack of competition in the live entertainment industry results in consumers having to pay higher prices.\r\n\r\n“Its dominance in markets up and down the live entertainment supply chain creates the incentive and the ability to limit competition and protect its market position,” she explained. “Customers pay the price for these monopolistic acts with higher ticket prices and fees, lower quality, less choice and less innovation.”\r\n\r\nOn the concert side, the company excludes “smaller or independent concert promoters and venues. In digital ticketing, it includes excluding ticket resellers and brokers who provide important competition via the secondary ticketing market,” she said.\r\n\r\nLawmaker says Ticketmaster merger should ‘be on the table’\r\nLawmakers repeatedly questioned the US government’s past handling of the Live Nation merger with Ticketmaster. It involved a legally binding consent agreement that allowed the company to merge with Ticketmaster so long as the combined company abided by a number of behavioral conditions.\r\n\r\nA 2019 Justice Department review found that Live Nation was not meeting its commitments under the order, but instead of suing, the Department modified the agreement and extended it for another five years, according to Bradish at the American Antitrust Institute.\r\n\r\n“DOJ should pursue new enforcement action to obtain effective structural relief,” said Bradish, calling for a breakup of Live Nation under either Section 7 of the Clayton Act or Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\r\n\r\nSen. Mike Lee said the way that history has unfolded since the Live Nation merger raises “very serious doubts” about the usefulness of consent agreements imposed by the federal government.\r\n\r\nIf the current Justice Department concludes that the consent decree has been violated, “unwinding the merger ought to be on the table,” Blumenthal said.\r\n\r\nConcerns over security, and pressure for accountability\r\nIn response to Berchtold’s explanation about the bot problem, some lawmakers questioned the company’s security practices, noting many small businesses can determine when bad actors are infiltrating their systems.\r\n\r\nRepublican Senator Marsha Blackburn suggested Berchtold strengthen its cyberprotections, get better advice and hire new IT workers to better protect its systems. (Berchtold said the company has poured billions of dollars into security to protect its systems over the years.)\r\n\r\nAnother Republican, Sen. John Kennedy, went further in criticizing the company over the Swift ticketing issue. He said whoever at Live Nation was in charge of the incident “ought to be fired.”\r\n\r\nNo easy answers\r\nIn the back half of the hearing, some of the focus shifted to possible solutions – but there were no easy answers.\r\n\r\nSome lawmakers focused on the ability to resell tickets. While this option can be useful for customers who need to change plans, it can also help prop up the scalping market.\r\n\r\nWhen senators discussed whether restricting the ability to transfer tickets would help, Live Nation’s exec was in favor of it. But the SeatGeek CEO said this might only entrench Live Nation’s dominance, as it holds the kind of market share that would force consumers to solely transact there in the absence of other resale market options.\r\n\r\n– CNN’s Brian Fung and Aditi Sangal contributed to this report', '230124141154-09-us-ticketing-industry-taylor-swift-senate-hearing-0124.jpg', 'Joe Berchtold, president and CFO of Live Nation Entertainment, Inc, speaks during a US Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on promoting competition and protecting consumers in live entertainment, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on January 24, 2023.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 02:53:13', '2023-02-01 02:53:13'),
(33, 'DOJ sues Google over its dominance in online advertising market', 5, 'The Justice Department and eight states sued Google on Tuesday, accusing the company of harming competition with its dominance in the online advertising market and calling for it to be broken up.\r\n\r\nThe move marks the Biden administration’s first blockbuster antitrust case against a Big Tech company. The eight states joining the suit include California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe fresh complaint significantly escalates the risks to Google emanating from Washington, where lawmakers and regulators have frequently raised concerns about the tech giant’s power but have so far failed to pass new legislation or regulations that might rein in the company or its peers.\r\n\r\nFor years, Google’s critics have claimed that the company’s extensive role in the digital ecosystem that enables advertisers to place ads, and for publishers to offer up digital ad space, represents a conflict of interest that Google has exploited anticompetitively.\r\n\r\nIn Tuesday’s complaint, a copy of which was viewed by CNN, the Justice Department alleged that Google actively and illegally maintained that dominance by engaging in a campaign to thwart competition. Google gobbled up rivals through anticompetitive mergers, the US government said, and bullied publishers and advertisers into using the company’s proprietary ad technology products.\r\n\r\nFor 15 years, Google’s alleged anticompetitive behavior led to lower ad revenues for websites and publishers, as well as higher advertising costs for marketers, said Attorney General Merrick Garland during a press conference Tuesday. Even the US government was harmed, according to the complaint, which named the US Army as one of multiple government advertisers using Google’s tools. Since 2019, the US government has spent $100 million buying online ads, the complaint said.\r\n\r\nAs part of the lawsuit, the US government called for Google to be broken up and for the court to order the company to spin off at least its online advertising exchange and its ad server for publishers, if not more.\r\n\r\nGoogle, the US government alleged, “has corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising. Having inserted itself into all aspects of the digital advertising marketplace, Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful means to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies.”\r\n\r\nThe suit was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\r\n\r\nTuesday’s suit marks the federal government’s second antitrust complaint against Google since 2020, when the Trump administration sued over Google’s alleged anticompetitive harms in search and search advertising. That case is still ongoing. Google has also been the target of antitrust litigation by state and private actors.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, Google said the DOJ suit “attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector.”\r\n\r\n“DOJ is doubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow,” a Google spokesperson said, adding that a federal judge last year knocked down a claim that Google colluded with Facebook in a separate antitrust suit led by the state of Texas. That judge also ruled, however, that a number of monopolization claims in the Texas case could move forward.\r\n\r\nAsked to respond to Google’s statement, Garland said Tuesday: “We don’t pick winners or losers. We pick those who violate the antitrust laws. Those are the people we sue.”\r\n\r\nGoogle’s core ad sales machine comes under scrutiny\r\nThe lawsuit is a frontal assault against Google’s massive, primary business of advertising. Google generated $209 billion in advertising revenue in 2021, according to its annual report, a figure representing more than 80% of its total revenue. By comparison, the next largest giant in online advertising, Facebook-parent Meta, generated $115 billion in 2021. (Tuesday’s suit targets a subset of Google’s ad revenue represented by display advertising, a roughly $32 billion business for the company.)\r\n\r\nThird-party estimates suggest that Google and Facebook accounted for the majority of US digital ad revenues, hitting a peak around 2017, with Google taking about a third of the market. Since then, however, others including Amazon have begun encroaching on that business.\r\n\r\nThe US complaint echoes concerns that have prompted similar antitrust investigations in the United Kingdom and in the European Union.\r\n\r\nGoogle not only controls the platform publishers use to sell online ad inventory, the Justice Department alleged Tuesday, but also the advertising tools marketers use to claim that inventory and the exchange that facilitates those transactions.\r\n\r\n“Google’s pervasive power over the entire ad tech industry has been questioned by its own digital advertising executives,” the complaint said, “at least one of whom aptly begged the question: ‘[I]s there a deeper issue with us owning the platform, the exchange, and a huge network? The analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE.’”\r\n\r\nTuesday’s complaint marks an opening salvo against Big Tech by DOJ’s antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter. Kanter has spent months laying the groundwork for a broader offensive against the tech industry’s most dominant companies, reflecting commitments by President Joe Biden and others in the US government to hold powerful firms accountable. Under Kanter, Justice Department antitrust officials have pushed to bring more cases to trial as well as to prosecute cases involving unconventional legal theories.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Kanter told reporters that Google abused “longstanding monopolies in digital advertising technologies” to give itself an advantage.\r\n\r\n“Google’s own documents estimate that it keeps at least 30 cents of each advertising dollar that flows through Google’s advertising tools,” Kanter said, adding that in some situations the figure may be far higher.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, House lawmakers released a 450-page report finding that Google, along with Amazon, Apple and Facebook, hold “monopoly power” in key business segments. The report was the result of a 16-month investigation in which congressional staff reviewed corporate documents and interviewed the tech industry’s many customers and rivals. It concluded, among other things, that Google was uniquely positioned to benefit from its powerful role in the online ad industry.\r\n\r\n“With a sizable share in the ad exchange market and the ad intermediary market, and as a leading supplier of ad space, Google simultaneously acts on behalf of publishers and advertisers, while also trading for itself,” the report said.', '230124091418-google-company-logo.jpg', 'Google parent company Alphabet announces plans to lay off approximately 12,000 employees representing 6% of its global workforce in an effort to cut costs in the latest sign of a slowing economy.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 02:54:08', '2023-02-01 02:54:08'),
(34, 'Children lost about 35% of a normal school year’s worth of learning during the pandemic, study suggests', 6, 'A new paper adds to the mounting evidence that school-age children across the globe experienced significant setbacks in their learning progress during the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nStudents “lost out on about 35% of a normal school year’s worth of learning” when in-person learning stopped during the public health crisis, according to a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. The school closures were intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but the new paper suggests that learning deficits emerged and persisted over time. The paper included data from 15 different countries.\r\n\r\n“Schoolchildren’s learning progress slowed down substantially during the pandemic. So on average, children lost out on about one-third of what they would have usually learned in a normal school year, and these learning deficits arose quite early in the pandemic,” said Bastian Betthäuser, an author of the paper and researcher at the Sciences Po Centre for Research on Social Inequalities in France and the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n“Children still have not recovered the learning that they lost out on at the start of the pandemic,” he said. Also, “education inequality between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds increased during the pandemic. So the learning crisis is an equality crisis. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds were disproportionately affected by school closures.”\r\n\r\nThe researchers reviewed and analyzed data from 42 studies on learning progress during the pandemic across 15 countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United States. The studies were published between March 2020 and August 2022. The researchers conducted an initial search for the studies in April 2021 and additional searches in February and August 2022.\r\n\r\n“We systematically reviewed all of the existing research on school children’s learning progress during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Betthäuser said. “And it’s important to note that most of the existing research comes from high- and middle-income countries, whereas there’s a few studies from low-income countries.”\r\n\r\nThe data showed that learning deficits during school closures and lockdowns in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were likely to have been “particularly pronounced” for children from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and learning progress slowed more for mathematics than for reading skills.\r\n\r\nData specifically from the United States and the United Kingdom was “pretty similar,” Betthäuser said, and translated to slightly more than a third of a school year worth of learning progress lost, on average.\r\n\r\nThe paper reveals that the international evidence of learning loss during the early days of the pandemic mirrors the US experience, Thomas Kane, faculty director of the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University, said in an email.\r\n\r\n“One important difference is that remote schooling had a disproportionately negative effect on high-poverty students in the U.S. It was not just the pandemic. Gaps widened less in school districts that returned to in-person learning more quickly,” wrote Kane, who was not involved in the new research. “If we do not act decisively now, learning loss will be the longest-lasting and most inequitable consequence of the pandemic.”\r\n\r\nKane suggested that school districts take steps such as adding tutoring and learning time through expanded summer programs or longer school years.\r\n\r\nAlthough this data on learning loss during the pandemic is not itself new, the new paper shows how the findings have been consistent, Susanna Loeb, professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education, said in an email.\r\n\r\n“Students, on average, are far behind where they would have been without the pandemic and this reduced learning is much greater for groups of students who were already more likely to be struggling in school,” wrote Loeb, who also was not involved with the paper.\r\n\r\nIn October, results from the 2022 US National Assessment of Educational Progress exams, often called the “Nation’s Report Card,” showed that fourth- and eighth-graders fell behind in reading and had the largest ever decline in math in the United States. It was the first national assessment of student achievement in three years since Covid-19 emerged, and revealed the devastating effect of the pandemic on learning.\r\n\r\nResults from a Pew Research Center survey, published in October, suggest that about 61% of parents of K-12 students say the first year of the pandemic had a negative effect on their children’s education; 7% say it had a positive effect, and 28% say it had neither a positive nor negative effect.\r\n\r\nAmong those who say the pandemic had a negative effect on their children’s education, 44% said that was still the case, while 56% said the impact was only temporary. The survey included 3,251 parents.\r\n\r\n“I do believe that parents should be concerned about their children’s missed learning as a result of the pandemic,” Loeb said. “We have tons of evidence that what students learn in school contributes markedly to their later success – high school graduation, college going, even labor market opportunities and their long-term well-being. Parents can help by encouraging their children to reengage with classmates and teachers and with positive learning habits.”', '230126172352-01-classrooms-pandemic-stock.jpg', 'Children lost about 35% of a normal school year’s worth of learning during the pandemic, study suggests', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:01:07', '2023-02-01 03:01:07');

Stacey, who works primarily with teenagers and college students, previously told CNN using social media releases a “dopamine dump” in the brain.\r\n\r\n“When we do things that are addictive like use cocaine or use smartphones, our brains release a lot of dopamine at once. It tells our brains to keep using that,” she said. “For teenagers in particular, this part of their brain is actually hyperactive compared to adults. They can’t get motivated to do anything else.”\r\n\r\nRecent studies demonstrate other ways excessive screen time can impact brain development. In young children, for example, excessive screen time was significantly associated with poorer emerging literacy skills and ability to use expressive language.\r\n\r\nLawmakers are paying attention\r\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy, who recently published an op-ed in the Bulwark about loneliness and mental health, echoed the surgeon general’s concerns about social media. “We have lost something as a society, as so much of our life has turned into screen-to-screen communication, it just doesn’t give you the same sense of value and the same sense of satisfaction as talking to somebody or seeing someone,” Murphy told CNN in an interview alongside Murthy.\r\n\r\nFor both Murphy and Murthy, the issue of social media addiction is personal. Both men are fathers – Murphy to teenagers and Murthy to young children. “It’s not coincidental that Dr. Murthy and I are probably talking more about this issue of loneliness more than others in public life,” Murphy told CNN. “I look at this through the prism of my 14-year-old and my 11-year-old.”\r\n\r\nAs a country, Murphy explained, the U.S. is not powerless in the face of Big Tech. Lawmakers could make different decisions about limiting young kids from social media and incentivizing companies to make algorithms less addictive.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon general similarly addressed addictive algorithms, explaining pitting adolescents against Big Tech is “just not a fair fight.” He told CNN, “You have some of the best designers and product developers in the world who have designed these products to make sure people are maximizing the amount of time they spend on these platforms. And if we tell a child, use the force of your willpower to control how much time you’re spending, you’re pitting a child against the world’s greatest product designers.”\r\n\r\nDespite the hurdles facing parents and kids, Murphy struck a note of optimism about the future of social media.\r\n\r\n“None of this is out of our control. When we had dangerous vehicles on the road, we passed laws to make those vehicles less dangerous,” he told CNN. “We should make decisions to make [social media] a healthier experience that would make kids feel better about themselves and less alone.”', '221116101629-teens-social-media-stock.jpg', 'Surgeon General says 13 is ‘too early’ to join social media', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:01:56', '2023-02-01 03:01:56'),

For each additional 10% increase in ultraprocessed food consumption, the risk of dying from any cancer increased by 6%, while the risk of dying from ovarian cancer rose by 30%, according to the statement.\r\n\r\n“These associations persisted after adjustment for a range of socio-demographic, smoking status, physical activity, and key dietary factors,” the authors wrote.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to death from cancer among women, ovarian cancer is ranked fifth, “accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system,” noted the American Cancer Society.\r\n\r\n“The findings add to previous studies showing an association between a greater proportion of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in the diet and a higher risk of obesity, heart attacks, stroke, and type 2 diabetes,” said Simon Steenson, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, a charity partially supported by food producers and manufacturers. Steenson was not involved in the new study.\r\n\r\n“However, an important limitation of these previous studies and the new analysis published today is that the findings are observational and so do not provide evidence of a clear causal link between UPFs and cancer, or the risk of other diseases,” Steenson said in an email.\r\n\r\nGathering evidence\r\nPeople who ate the most ultraprocessed foods “were younger and less likely to have a family history of cancer,” Chang and her colleagues wrote.\r\n\r\nHigh consumers of ultraprocessed foods were less likely to do physical activity and more likely to be classified as obese. These people were also likely to have lower household incomes and education and live in the most underprivileged communities, the study found.\r\n\r\n“This study adds to the growing evidence that ultra-processed foods are likely to negatively impact our health including our risk for cancer,” said Dr. Eszter Vamos, the study’s lead author and a clinical senior lecturer at Imperial College London’s School of Public Health in a statement.\r\n\r\nThis latest research is not the first to show an association between a high intake of ultraprocessed foods and cancer.\r\n\r\nA 2022 study examined the diets of over 200,000 men and women in the United States for up to 28 years and found a link between ultraprocessed foods and colorectal cancer — the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States — in men, but not women.\r\n\r\nAnd there are “literally hundreds of studies (that) link ultraprocessed foods to obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality,” Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University told CNN previously.\r\n\r\nWhile the new UK-based study cannot prove causation, only an association, “other available evidence shows that reducing ultra-processed foods in our diet could provide important health benefits,” Vamos said.\r\n\r\n“Further research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the best public health strategies to reduce the widespread presence and harms of ultra-processed foods in our diet,” she added.', '230130112522-women-eating-pizza-stock.jpg', 'Cancer risk and mortality, especially for ovarian cancer, rose as more ultraprocessed foods were eaten, a new study found.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:06:46', '2023-02-01 03:06:46'),
(38, 'Why eggs have been so expensive this year', 7, '\r\nSeveral grocery items have gotten more expensive this year. But nothing comes close to the rise in egg prices.\r\n\r\nIn the year through November, not adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices jumped 49%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\r\n\r\nSince early this year, a deadly avian flu has been reducing poultry flocks — specifically turkeys and egg-laying hens. That’s one reason for the unrelenting increase in prices. But the situation has been exacerbated by elevated feed and energy costs for producers, in addition to high demand in the supermarket.\r\n\r\nExperts think that the peak has passed, but until these conditions improve, expect to pay more for eggs in the grocery store.\r\n\r\nWholesale prices hit a record\r\nAvian flu has been a problem in the US for several months now, but in recent weeks wholesale prices have been hitting records.\r\n\r\nAs of last week, “prices have been escalating for nine consecutive weeks… setting new record highs on a daily basis since the week of Thanksgiving,” said Karyn Rispoli, editor of the Egg Price Current for Urner Barry, which offers food market data.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, Midwest large eggs, the benchmark for eggs sold in their shells, hit $5.46 per dozen, Rispoli said, citing Urner Barry’s data. This time last year, Urner Berry’s data shows, that price was around $1.70.\r\n\r\nOne reason for the increase? Not enough supply.\r\n\r\n“There’s simply not been enough production to support the incredibly strong retail demand we’ve seen this year,” Rispoli said. Supply has been constrained by the deadly bird flu.\r\n\r\nThe current outbreak of Highly-Pathogenic Avian Influenza started in the US around February, and has persisted throughout the year. The last major bird flu outbreak in the United States was in 2015. But that one was contained by June of that year, noted Brian Earnest, lead economist for animal protein in CoBank.\r\n\r\n“This year, we’ve continued to see flock depopulations throughout the entire year, and there’s an expectation that we’ll continue to see it into 2023,” he said, noting that he expects “we’re going to see a tight supply situation and elevated pricing environment moving forward.”\r\n\r\nAbout 60 million birds are gone because of the disease so far, according to the USDA. Of those, about 43 million are egg-laying hens, according to USDA data provided by the American Egg Board, a farmer-funded group which markets eggs.\r\n\r\nStill, farmers have been able to moderate the losses. “Our producers learned a lot of hard lessons from 2015,” said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board. Some farmers have been able to repopulate their flocks, decreasing the net impact on flock sizes and egg supplies. As of early December, there were about 308 million hens laying eggs for consumption, down from about 328 million in December 2021, according to the USDA.\r\n\r\nThe supply squeeze isn’t the only thing contributing to higher egg prices, said Metz. Higher fuel, feed and other producer cost are also driving up wholesale prices, she said. And then there’s that high demand for eggs, which spikes this time of year.\r\n\r\nEgg demand remains high\r\nPeople buy more eggs around the holidays, when they’re baking and cooking more, and eating breakfast at home more often.\r\n\r\nWholesale prices tend to go up in the winter because of those habits, noted Earnest. That has “brought about a very strong market condition.”\r\n\r\nYear-round demand for eggs has also also been strong.\r\n\r\nEven while prices have soared, sales of eggs have only ticked down about 2% by unit in retail in the year through December 4th, according to data from IRI, a market research firm.\r\n\r\nShoppers have been accepting high prices at the grocery store as they pull back on restaurant visits. And even though eggs have gotten more expensive, they still cost less than other proteins.\r\n\r\nAs that peak holiday demand passes, wholesale prices are expected to fall.\r\n\r\n“Based on current trade values and market conditions, it appears that the market may have finally reached its peak,” said Rispoli. Friday’s wholesale prices were the same as Thursday’s, the first time pricing held steady since October, she said.\r\n\r\n“Several suppliers have reported to us… that they are seeing their orders slow,” in the week leading up to Christmas, she added. By then, “most grocers have pulled in whatever inventory they’ll need for the holidays.”\r\n\r\nIt might take another three to six months for prices to moderate in retail, said KK Davey, president of thought leadership at IRI and NPD, and even longer for prices to come down to what they were last year.\r\n\r\n“It may take some more time,” he said.', '221227090440-01-egg-prices-2022.jpg', 'Eggs have gotten much more expensive this year.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:12:01', '2023-02-01 03:12:01'),

In that same period, overall inflation rose 7.1%.\r\n\r\nFood prices are affected by a number of factors, including extreme weather, diseases impacting crops and livestock, supply chain complications and geopolitical unrest including the war in Ukraine. That makes it more difficult for the US government to use tactics like raising interest rates to moderate food prices.\r\n\r\nA number of pantry and refrigerator staples continued to get more expensive last month, the latest data shows. Eggs, which have been affected by the deadly avian flu, were a staggering 49.1% more expensive through November, and butter prices, hit by a contraction in the milk supply, shot up 27%.\r\n\r\nFlour prices jumped 24.9%, bread went up 15.7%, milk was 14.7% more expensive and coffee prices rose 14.6%. Chicken was up 12% and fruits and vegetables spiked 9.7%.\r\n\r\nThere were some items that got cheaper over the course of the year, particularly in the meat aisle.\r\n\r\nUncooked beef roasts fell 8.1%, and uncooked beef steaks dropped 7.4%. Pork roasts, steaks and ribs slipped 5.1%, and bacon ticked down 1.1%.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in November\r\nGrocery and menu prices in November each went up 0.5% from the prior month, adjusted for seasonal swings.\r\n\r\nMany individual items got even more expensive, with lettuce taking the lead with an 8.9% spike. The US lettuce supply has been hurt by crop disease: In California, where much of it is grown, there was a “high incidence of virus infection that has affected the crop pretty significantly in some fields,” Almuhanad Melhim, a fruit and vegetable analyst at Rabobank, previously told CNN. “That led to really low supply and low quality of lettuce.”\r\n\r\nLast month, eggs and fresh fruit each got 2.3% more expensive, and bread and ice cream each rose 2% from October.\r\n\r\nIn restaurants, where traffic has been slowing as consumers tighten their belts, menu prices went up, but not by much. At limited-service restaurants, menu prices rose 0.6%, while prices at full-service restaurants ticked up 0.4%.\r\n\r\nThere were some bright spots in the grocery aisle, too, compared to last month.\r\n\r\nBacon fell 1.8%. Uncooked beef roasts fell 1.3% and uncooked ground beef dropped 0.9%. Chicken, which is overcoming some supply issues, went down 0.8%, while fresh fish and seafood dropped 1.4%. Potatoes also got 1.4% cheaper, and margarine prices fell 2.3%.\r\n\r\nBut the declines in beef prices may not last long. Cattle ranchers, facing devastating droughts, have recently been selling cattle for slaughter in high numbers.

(43, 'Taiwan’s military has a fertility problem: As China fears grow, its recruitment pool shrinks', 2, 'Taiwan has noticed a hole in its defense plans that is steadily getting bigger. And it’s not one easily plugged by boosting the budget or buying more weapons.\r\n\r\nThe island democracy of 23.5 million is facing an increasing challenge in recruiting enough young men to meet its military targets and its Interior Ministry has suggested the problem is – at least in part – due to its stubbornly low birth rate.\r\n\r\nTaiwan’s population fell for the first time in 2020, according to the ministry, which warned earlier this year that the 2022 military intake would be the lowest in a decade and that a continued drop in the youth population would pose a “huge challenge” for the future.\r\n\r\nThat’s bad news at a time when Taiwan is trying to bolster its forces to deter any potential invasion by China, whose ruling Communist Party has been making increasingly belligerent noises about its determination to “reunify” with the self-governed island – which it has never controlled – by force if necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd the outlook has darkened further with the release of a new report by Taiwan’s National Development Council projecting that by 2035 the island can expect roughly 20,000 fewer births per year than the 153,820 it recorded in 2021. By 2035, Taiwan will also overtake South Korea as the jurisdiction with the world’s lowest birth rate, the report added.\r\n\r\nSuch projections are feeding into a debate over whether the government should increase the period of mandatory military service that eligible young men must serve. Currently, the island has a professional military force made up of 162,000 (as of June this year) – 7,000 fewer than the target, according to a report by the Legislative Yuan. In addition to that number, all eligible men must serve four months of training as reservists.\r\n\r\nChanging the mandatory service requirement would be a major U-turn for Taiwan, which had previously been trying to cut down on conscription and shortened the mandatory service from 12 months as recently as 2018. But on Wednesday, Taiwan’s Minister of National Defence Chiu Kuo-cheng said such plans would be made public before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThat news has met with opposition among some young students in Taiwan, who have voiced their frustrations on PTT, Taiwan’s version of Reddit, even if there is support for the move among the wider public.\r\n\r\nA poll by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in March this year found that most Taiwanese agreed with a proposal to lengthen the service period. It found that 75.9% of respondents thought it reasonable to extend it to a year; only 17.8% were opposed.\r\n\r\nMany experts argue there is simply no other option.\r\n\r\nSu Tzu-yun, a director of Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said that before 2016, the pool of men eligible to join the military – either as career soldiers or as reservists – was about 110,000. Since then, he said, the number had declined every year and the pool would likely be as low as 74,000 by 2025.\r\n\r\nAnd within the next decade, Su said, the number of young adults available for recruitment by the Taiwanese military could drop by as much as a third.\r\n\r\n“This is a national security issue for us,” he said. “The population pool is decreasing, so we are actively considering whether to resume conscription to meet our military needs.\r\n\r\n“We are now facing an increasing threat (from China), and we need to have more firepower and manpower.”\r\n\r\nA unique problem?\r\nTaiwan’s low birth rate – 0.98 – is far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population, but it is no outlier in East Asia.\r\n\r\nIn November, South Korea broke its own world record when its birth rate dropped to 0.79, while Japan’s fell to 1.3 and mainland China hit 1.15.\r\n\r\nEven so, experts say the trend poses a unique problem for Taiwan’s military, given the relative size of the island and the threats it faces.\r\n\r\nChina has been making increasingly aggressive noises toward the island since August, when then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi controversially visited Taipei. Not long after she landed in Taiwan, Beijing also launched a series of unprecedented military exercises around the island.\r\n\r\nSince then, the temperature has remained high – particularly as Chinese leader Xi Jinping told a key Communist Party meeting in October that “reunification” was inevitable and that he reserves the option of taking “all measures necessary.”\r\n\r\nChang Yan-ting, a former deputy commander of Taiwan’s air force, said that while low birth rates were common across East Asia, “the situation in Taiwan is very different” as the island was facing “more and more pressure (from China) and the situation will become more acute.”\r\n\r\n“The United States has military bases in Japan and South Korea, while Singapore does not face an acute military threat from its neighbors. Taiwan faces the greatest threat and declining birth rate will make the situation even more serious,” he added.\r\n\r\nRoy Lee, a deputy executive director at Taiwan’s Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research, agreed that the security threats facing Taiwan were greater than those in the rest of the region.\r\n\r\n“The situation is more challenging for Taiwan, because our population base is smaller than other countries facing similar problems,” he added.\r\n\r\nTaiwan’s population is 23.5 million, compared to South Korea’s 52 million, Japan’s 126 million and China’s 1.4 billion.\r\n\r\nNot just a recruitment problem\r\nBesides the shrinking recruitment pool, the decline in the youth population could also threaten the long-term performance of Taiwan’s economy – which is itself a pillar of the island’s defense.\r\n\r\nTaiwan is the world’s 21st largest economy, according to the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research, and had a GDP of $668.51 billion last year.\r\n\r\nMuch of its economic heft comes from its leading role in the supply of semiconductor chips, which play an indispensable role in everything from smartphones to computers.\r\n\r\nTaiwan’s homegrown semiconductor giant TSMC is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy – as well as to China – that it is sometimes referred to as forming part of a “silicon shield” against a potential military invasion by Beijing, as its presence would give a strong incentive to the West to intervene.\r\n\r\nLee noted that population levels are closely intertwined with gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic activity. A population decline of 200,000 people could result in a 0.4% decline in GDP, all else being equal, he said.\r\n\r\n“It is very difficult to increase GDP by 0.4%, and would require a lot of effort. So the fact that a declining population can take away that much growth is big,” he said.\r\n\r\nFighting back\r\nTaiwan’s government has brought in a series of measures aimed at encouraging people to have babies, but with limited success.\r\n\r\nIt pays parents a monthly stipend of 5,000 Taiwan dollars (US$161) for their first baby, and a higher amount for each additional one.\r\n\r\nSince last year, pregnant women have been eligible for seven days of leave for obstetrics checks prior to giving birth.\r\n\r\nOutside the military, in the wider economy, the island has been encouraging migrant workers to fill job vacancies.\r\n\r\nStatistics from the National Development Council showed that about 670,000 migrant workers were in Taiwan at the end of last year – comprising about 3% of the population.\r\n\r\nMost of the migrant workers are employed in the manufacturing sector, the council said, the vast majority of them from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.\r\n\r\nLee said in the long term the Taiwanese government would likely have to reform its immigration policies to bring in more migrant workers.\r\n\r\nStill, there are those who say Taiwan’s low birth rate is no reason to panic, just yet.\r\n\r\nAlice Cheng, an associate professor in sociology at Taiwan’s Academia Sinica, cautioned against reading too much into population trends as they were affected by so many factors.\r\n\r\nShe pointed out that just a few decades ago, many demographers were warning of food shortages caused by a population explosion.\r\n\r\nAnd even if the low birth rate endured, that might be no bad thing if it were a reflection of an improvement in women’s rights, she said.\r\n\r\n“The educational expansion that took place in the 70s and 80s in East Asia dramatically changed women’s status. It really pushed women out of their homes because they had knowledge, education and career prospects,” she said.\r\n\r\n“The next thing you see globally is that once women’s education level improved, fertility rates started declining.”\r\n\r\n“All these East Asian countries are really scratching their head and trying to think about policies and interventions to boost fertility rates,” she added.\r\n\r\n“But if that’s something that really, (women) don’t want, can you push them to do that?”', '221209142439-military-cadet-file.jpg', 'A military cadet graduates in Taipei, Taiwan, in 2018.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:22:12', '2023-02-01 03:22:12'),

The island began introducing longer training schedules for its reservists, and its Defense Ministry closely studied the tactics of war in Ukraine to improve battle strategy.\r\n\r\nBut while lengthening the conscription period may help boost manpower in the military, defense experts say there must also be a focus on how conscripts can receive training that suits the modern needs of Taiwan’s defense if conflict were to occur.\r\n\r\n“In any potential battle between China and Taiwan, ground warfare will likely take place at a later stage, because Chinese soldiers can only make an amphibious landing after taking control of the air and the sea,” said Lin Ying-yu, an assistant professor at Tamkang University’s Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies.\r\n\r\n“But before they land, there will likely be bombing and blockade, and we need people to deliver goods and guide residents to air raid shelters.\r\n\r\n“So while we extend the conscription period, I think it is more important to consider how the conscripts will be incorporated into our overall defense strategy, and ensure their training is effective in achieving those objectives.”', '221227163501-taiwan-military-service.jpg', 'Taiwanese flags are seen at the Ministry of National Defence of Taiwan in Taipei, Taiwan, December 26, 2022.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:23:37', '2023-02-01 03:23:37'),

However, the move is likely to provoke anger from Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of China.\r\n\r\nIn September, the administration approved more than $1.1 billion in arm sales to Taiwan, the largest in President Joe Biden’s tenure, which included up to 60 anti-ship missiles and up to 100 air-to-air missiles.\r\n\r\nThat sale came shortly after tensions between China and the US were inflamed following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in early August.\r\n\r\nIn August 2021, the administration put forward a $750 weapons sale to Taiwan consisting of 40 M109A6 Medium Self-Propelled Howitzer Systems and related equipment.\r\n\r\nNews of the latest approval comes after Biden signed into law last week a sweeping new defense bill that included the establishment of a defense modernization program for Taiwan to deter Chinese aggression.', '221229134112-taiwanese-flags-file.jpg', 'Taiwanese flags during the National Day celebration in Keelung, Taiwan, on Monday, October 10, 2022.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:24:06', '2023-02-01 03:24:06'),

He was briefing reporters after returning to Taipei from Bangkok, where he was representing Taiwan at the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders.\r\n\r\nAt APEC, Chang discussed the semiconductor industry with Vice President Kamala Harris and also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Harris welcomed TSMC’s investment in Arizona, he said.\r\n\r\nSuper-advanced semiconductor chips — like the ones produced by TSMC — are an indispensable part of everything from smartphones to washing machines. They are also difficult to make because of the high cost of development and the level of knowledge required, meaning much of the production is concentrated in just a handful of suppliers.\r\n\r\nAdvances in chip manufacturing require etching ever-smaller transistors on to silicon wafers. Chang said its plant in Arizona will produce 3-nanometer chips, TSMC’s most advanced technology.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, the company had already committed at least $12 billion to build its first facility in Arizona. At the time, the tech giant had said that the facility will “utilize TSMC’s 5-nanometer technology for semiconductor wafer fabrication” and “create over 1,600 high-tech professional jobs directly.” Production is expected to begin in 2024.\r\n\r\n“I not only believe, but know for a fact that the cost of manufacturing chips in the US will be at least 55% higher than in Taiwan,” Chang had said at a press meeting on Saturday on the sidelines of APEC.\r\n\r\n“But that does not mitigate against moving some capacity to the US. The chip manufacturing process we moved over is the most advanced of any company in the US, and that is very important to the US.”\r\n\r\nChang’s comments come only days after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had purchased a $4.1 billion stake in TSMC.\r\n\r\nThe increase in TSMC’s presence in the US comes at a time when tensions between China and Taiwan are escalating.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the island’s chip industry has become a global concern. Experts have warned that any disruption to Taiwan’s chip supply could paralyze production of key equipment, impacting almost everyone in the world.', '221121132958-tsmc-111622.jpg', 'Annabelle Chih/Getty Images', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:24:59', '2023-02-01 03:24:59'),

COMAC plans the first C919 delivery to China Eastern in December.\r\n\r\nTurning Point\r\nAnalysts say it will be some time before the C919 cracks open an entrenched Airbus-Boeing market duopoly outside China, but Tuesday’s display marked a turning point 10 years after first orders were unveiled at the same event.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the sun was setting in China on Tuesday on one of Europe’s most visible global symbols, the double-decker A380.\r\n\r\nTracking website FlightRadar24 said China Southern Airlines operated its last A380 flight from Los Angeles on Tuesday. The airline did not answer a request for comment.\r\n\r\nProduction of the world’s largest jetliner ended last year after weak sales including a near-failure to conquer China’s market. An auction of A380 parts was held in France last month.\r\n\r\nAnalysts say Airbus does however enjoy brisk demand for the best-selling A320neo, buoyed by US tensions that have delayed renewed Boeing MAX deliveries following a safety crisis.\r\n\r\nAirbus on Tuesday formally booked an order for 40 A320neo-family jets from all-Boeing operator Xiamen Airlines.\r\n\r\nChina watchers said the airline’s decision to loosen its dependence on Boeing was viewed as particularly symbolic after Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited the cockpit of a larger Xiamen 787 on a visit to Boeing’s Seattle-area factory in 2015.\r\n\r\nEurope also made new inroads with the certification for Chinese markets of its ATR 42-600 turboprop after a long wait.\r\n\r\nThe show unfolded against the backdrop of rising tensions between China and Taiwan after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August, sparking huge Chinese military exercises at a time when the world is also on edge over the Ukraine conflict.\r\n\r\nState-owned Global Times reported that a new anti-drone defence system built around the HQ-17AE short-range air defense missile complex would make its Zhuhai debut as a countermeasure for low, slow and small drones that are difficult to identify and attack with traditional anti-air systems.\r\n\r\nChina is also showing off a FH-97A “Loyal Wingman” drone model designed to coordinate with crewed aircraft, the newspaper reported. The aircraft is different from the FH-97 concept first displayed last year.\r\n\r\nThe FH-97 is nearly identical to the US-developed Kratos Defense and Security Solutions XQ-58A Valkyrie, which first flew in 2019, while the FH-97A looks more like Boeing’s Australian-developed MQ-28 Ghost Bat, photographs indicate.\r\n\r\n“Early images from the show suggest it will again be a major bazaar of Chinese UAV technology, including what appear to be mockups of unmanned combat aircraft that could one day accompany Chinese J-20 fighters into combat,” Waldron said.\r\n\r\n“Still, it can be very hard to understand if the various UAV models at the show represent real programmes with investment from the Chinese military.”', '221108214413-01-china-historic-air-show-110822.jpg', 'A C919 passenger aircraft takes to the skies on the opening day of Airshow China 2022, on November 8, in Zhuhai, Guangdong province.', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-02-01 03:27:48', '2023-02-01 03:27:48'),
